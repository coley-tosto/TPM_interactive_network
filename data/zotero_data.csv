The exchange rate peg is attacked if fundamentals reach a critical threshold, or if there is a sufficiently large public shock. Large shocks generate doubt amongst investors about both the state of the world and about what others know, giving rise to multiple equilibria. We find a non‐monotonic relationship between tail risk and the probability of (a fundamentals‐based) crisis and show how this effect depends on the magnitude and direction of public shocks. We consider the implications of policy intervention and identify conditions under which active intervention produces doubt about the level of fundamentals and, hence, how others will respond.

Experiments were conducted with a GCM with either a slab ocean or fixed SSTs and sea ice, in which the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) and coastal Antarctic topography were either lowered or raised in an idealized way. Additional experiments were conducted with a fully coupled GCM with topographic perturbations based on an ice-sheet model in which the WAIS collapses. The response over the continent is the same in all model configurations and is mostly linear. In contrast, the response has substantial nonlinear elements over the Southern Ocean that depend on the model configuration and are due to feedbacks with sea ice, ocean, and clouds. The atmosphere warms near the surface over much of the Southern Ocean and cools in the stratosphere over Antarctica, whether topography is raised or lowered. When topography is lowered, the Southern Ocean surface warming is due to strengthened southward atmospheric heat transport and associated enhanced storminess over the WAIS and the high latitudes of the Southern Ocean. When topography is raised, Southern Ocean warming is more limited and is associated with circulation anomalies. The response in the fully coupled experiments is generally consistent with the more idealized experiments, but the full-depth ocean warms throughout the water column whether topography is raised or lowered. These results indicate that ice sheet–climate system feedbacks differ depending on whether the Antarctic ice sheet is gaining or losing mass.                            Significance Statement               Throughout Earth’s history, the Antarctic ice sheet was at times taller or shorter than it is today. The purpose of this study is to investigate how the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean around Antarctica respond to changes in ice sheet height. We find that the response to lowering the ice sheet is not the opposite of the response to raising it, and that in either case the ocean surface near the continent warms. When the ice sheet is raised, the ocean warming is related to circulation changes; when the ice sheet is lowered, the ocean warming is from an increase in southward atmospheric heat transport. These results are important for understanding how the ice sheet height and local climate evolve together through time.",15/09/2023,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 1:09,15/04/2024 5:39,6195-6212,,18,36,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.ametsoc.org/PUBSReuseLicenses,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\JQI5N6UX\Pauling et al. - 2023 - Linearity of the Climate System Response to Raisin.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic selection is one possible path to reduce the environmental impact of livestock production, but these traits are difficult and expensive to measure on many animals. The rumen microbiome may serve as a proxy for these traits due to its role in feed digestion. Restriction enzyme-reduced representation sequencing (RE-RRS) is a high-throughput and cost-effective approach to rumen metagenome profiling, but the systematic (e.g., sequencing) and biological factors influencing the resulting reference based (RB) and reference free (RF) profiles need to be explored before widespread industry adoption is possible. RESULTS: Metagenome profiles were generated by RE-RRS of 4,479 rumen samples collected from 1,708 sheep, and assigned to eight groups based on diet, age, time off feed, and country (New Zealand or Australia) at the time of sample collection. Systematic effects were found to have minimal influence on metagenome profiles. Diet was a major driver of differences between samples, followed by time off feed, then age of the sheep. The RF approach resulted in more reads being assigned per sample and afforded greater resolution when distinguishing between groups than the RB approach. Normalizing relative abundances within the sampling Cohort abolished structures related to age, diet, and time off feed, allowing a clear signal based on methane emissions to be elucidated. Genus-level abundances of rumen microbes showed low-to-moderate heritability and repeatability and were consistent between diets. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in rumen metagenomic profiles was influenced by diet, age, time off feed and genetics. Not accounting for environmental factors may limit the ability to associate the profile with traits of interest. However, these differences can be accounted for by adjusting for Cohort effects, revealing robust biological signals. The abundances of some genera were consistently heritable and repeatable across different environments, suggesting that metagenomic profiles could be used to predict an individual's future performance, or performance of its offspring, in a range of environments. These results highlight the potential of using rumen metagenomic profiles for selection purposes in a practical, agricultural setting.",18/09/2023,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 1:09,,551-551,,1,24,,BMC Genomics,,,,,,,,eng,,,PubMed,37723422,,,Number: 1 Place: England,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\638L8SKK\Hess et al. - 2023 - Large-scale analysis of sheep rumen metagenome pro.pdf; ; ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10506323/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10506323/,Animals; Genetics; Genotyping-by-sequencing; *Metagenome; *Microbiota; Livestock; Metagenome; Methane; Reference based; Reference free; Restriction enzyme reduced representation sequencing; Rumen; Rumen microbiome; Sheep/genetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The management of this pest using synthetic pesticides is problematic because of the development of pesticide resistance and environmental concerns including impacts on non-target organisms. The predatory bug Engytatus nicotianae has recently been identified as a useful biocontrol agent for TPP in greenhouses. The soil fungus Trichoderma Pers. is commonly used as a plant growth enhancer and biocontrol agent against phytopathogenic fungi. Therefore, there could be advantages associated with the combined use of these biocontrol agents. Some reports in other systems suggest that Trichoderma inoculation may alter the behaviour of pests and their natural enemies by modifying plant defence metabolites such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). For this reason, this study aimed to investigate the individual and combined efficacy of these biocontrol agents (i.e., Trichoderma atroviride and E. nicotianae) against TPP in greenhouse grown tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Merlice). To this end, we compared the effect of each biocontrol agent and their combination on TPP abundance across different developmental stages (egg, nymphs, adults) and the number of infested leaves. We also investigated plant VOC emissions under the different treatments. Across all measured TPP stages, the treatments tested (E. nicotianae alone, T. atrovirdae alone, and T. atrovirdae + E. nicotianae) significantly reduced mean TPP counts relative to the control, and no significant differences were observed in VOC emissions among treatments. Overall, T. atrovirdae alone was less effective than E. nicotianae alone and its combination with T. atrovirdae in suppressing TPP populations. However, the combined use of Trichoderma + E. nicotianae did not show significant advantages over the use of E. nicotianae alone in controlling TPP. Therefore, their combined use needs to be further assessed in light of other advantages of Trichoderma to the crop (e.g., growth promotion or pathogen defence).",8/12/2023,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 1:08,15/04/2024 5:44,3019,,12,13,,Agronomy,,,,,,,,en,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\7J6649YW\Veronesi et al. - 2023 - Individual and Combined Effects of Predatory Bug E.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study provides a statistical quantification of how human influences have changed the frequencies of extreme temperatures in New Zealand, depending on the synoptic weather types. We use the ensembles under pre‐industrial conditions (natural scenarios with no human‐induced changes) and present‐day conditions (anthropogenic scenarios) from the weather@home regional climate model. The ensemble simulations under these two scenarios are used to identify how human influences have impacted the frequency and intensity of extreme temperatures based on their connection to different large‐scale circulation patterns derived using self‐organizing maps (SOMs). Over New Zealand, an average two to three fold rise in frequencies of extremes occurs irrespective of seasons due to anthropogenic influence with a mean temperature increase close to 1°C. For some synoptic situations, the frequency of extremes are especially enhanced; in particular, for low‐pressure centres to the northeast of New Zealand where the frequency of occurrence of daily temperature extremes has increased by a factor of 7 between anthropogenic and natural ensembles for the winter season, though these synoptic patterns rarely occur. For low‐pressure centres to the northwest of New Zealand, we observe high temperatures frequently in both anthropogenic and natural ensembles which we expect is probably associated with warm air advection from the Tropics. The frequency of occurrence of high temperatures in these synoptic patterns has also increased by a factor of 2 between the natural and anthropogenic ensembles. For these synoptic states, the extremes are observed in the North Island and along the east coast of the country with the highest temperature along the Canterbury coast and Northland.

Because genetic diversity can indicate species resilience to changing climate, its measurement is relevant to many national and global conservation policy targets. Many studies produce large amounts of genome-scale genetic diversity data for wild populations, but most (87%) do not include the associated spatial and temporal metadata necessary for them to be reused in monitoring programs or for acknowledging the sovereignty of nations or Indigenous peoples. We undertook a distributed datathon to quantify the availability of these missing metadata and to test the hypothesis that their availability decays with time. We also worked to remediate missing metadata by extracting them from associated published papers, online repositories, and direct communication with authors. Starting with 848 candidate genomic data sets (reduced representation and whole genome) from the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration, we determined that 561 contained mostly samples from wild populations.

Modification of seeding density is a potential method to manage loss of spat (~ 1–20-mm shell length), by reducing biofouling and intraspecific competition. Understanding the stress responses of spat in production systems during the early stages of aquaculture is a high priority for mussel farmers who aim to manage and optimise mussel production.

The effect of seeding density on TAC was variable among depths, sites, and times, whereas seeding density had no impact on LP. In late summer (February 2020), oxidative stress appeared to be higher compared to early summer (December 2019).

The purpose of this research is to understand how young women’s experiences of sport and physical activity were impacted by extended and repeated lockdowns, considerable social disruption, and ongoing risks of contagion. Our research draws upon interviews and focus groups with 44 young women (16–24 years) living in Aotearoa New Zealand during the pandemic. Recognizing that young women’s opportunities and experiences of sport and fitness (before, during and after the pandemic) vary considerably based on a range of socio-cultural factors, our sample was intentionally diverse, inviting young women from different ethnic and religious backgrounds, from rural and urban settings, and with a range of pre-pandemic sport and fitness experiences. Engaging an intersectional and affective sensibility, we reveal the complex ways that the pandemic impacted the young women’s embodied, relational and affective experiences of sport and fitness. Contrary to recent concerns about young women dropping out from sport and physical activity, our research reveals the varied ways the pandemic shifted young women’s relations with their own and others’ moving bodies, transforming their relationships with sport and fitness, with renewed understandings of the importance of physical activity for joy, connection, and wellbeing.",19/07/2023,15/04/2024 5:44,30/05/2024 1:06,15/04/2024 5:44,847-868,,3,3,,Youth,"“If You Didn’t Exercise during Lockdown, What Were You Even Doing?",,,,,,,en,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,"C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\A5XRCZKI\Thorpe et al. - 2023 - “If You Didn’t Exercise during Lockdown, What Were.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Native to the Palearctic, the starling has been intentionally introduced to North and South America, South Africa, Australia, and the Pacific Islands, enabling us to explore species traits that may contribute to its invasion success. Coupling the rich studies of life history and more recent explorations of genomic variation among invasions, we illustrate how eco-evolutionary dynamics shape the invasion success of this long-studied and widely distributed species. Especially informative is the comparison between Australian and North American invasions, because these populations colonized novel ranges concurrently and exhibit shared signals of selection despite distinct population histories. In this review, we describe population dynamics across the native and invasive ranges, identify putatively selected traits that may influence the starling’s spread, and suggest possible determinants of starling success world-wide.

Climatic niche shifts are known to occur across a range of taxa, however we do not currently understand whether climatic niche shifts can consistently be predicted across multiple introduced ranges. Using three congeneric weed species, we investigate whether climatic niche shifts in one introduced range are consistent in other ranges where the species has been introduced. We compared the climatic conditions occupied by               Rumex conglomeratus               ,               R. crispus               , and               R. obtusifolius               between their native range (Eurasia) and three different introduced ranges (North America, Australia, New Zealand). We considered metrics of niche overlap, expansion, unfilling, pioneering, and similarity to determine whether climatic niche shifts were consistent across ranges and congeners. We found that the presence and direction of climatic niche shifts was inconsistent between introduced ranges for each species. Within an introduced range, however, niche shifts were qualitatively similar among species. North America and New Zealand experienced diverging niche expansion into drier and wetter climates respectively, whilst the niche was conserved in Australia. This work highlights how unique characteristics of an introduced range and local introduction history can drive different niche shifts, and that comparisons between only the native and one introduced range may misrepresent a species’ capacity for niche shifts. However, predictions of climatic niche shifts could be improved by comparing related species in the introduced range rather than relying on the occupied environments of the native range.",2023-01,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 1:05,15/04/2024 5:28,79-96,,1,25,,Biol Invasions,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\BK278QM8\Carlin et al. - 2023 - Global assessment of three Rumex species reveals i.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expanding peri-urban rusa deer population in the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia is having undesirable impacts on human and ecological communities, but the spatial structure of this population has not been investigated. Genetic information on invasive species is potentially useful in identifying management units to mitigate undesirable impacts.     Aims   The aim of this study was to investigate population structure, characterise dispersal, and determine if natural and human-made landscape features affected gene flow in rusa deer invading the Illawarra region of New South Wales.     Methods   We used reduced representation sequencing (DArT-Seq) to analyse single nucleotide polymorphisms distributed throughout the genomic DNA of rusa deer culled during a management program. We used admixture and Principal Component Analyses to investigate population structure with respect to natural and human-made landscape features, and we investigated whether our genetic data supported the presence of sex-biased dispersal.     Key results   Genetic diversity was highest in the north, near the original introduction site. A railway line demarcated restricted gene flow. Surprisingly, the Illawarra escarpment, a prominent landscape feature, did not restrict gene flow. There was no evidence of sex-biased dispersal and seven individuals were identified as genetic outliers.     Conclusions   The genetic structure of the Illawarra rusa deer population is consistent with individuals spreading south from their introduction site in Royal National Park. The population is not panmictic, and a landscape feature associated with urbanisation was associated with increased spatial genetic structure. Outliers could indicate hybridisation or secondary incursion events.     Implications   Rusa deer can be expected to continue invading southwards in the Illawarra region, but landscape features associated with urbanisation might reduce dispersal across the landscape. The genetic structuring of the population identified three potential management units on which to prioritise ground shooting operations.",10/07/2023,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 1:04,15/04/2024 5:35,757-769,,9,50,,Wildlife Res.,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\XUFGQ3VS\Li-Williams et al. - 2023 - Genetic analysis reveals spatial structure in an e.pdf,,,,"Nugent, Graham",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examine an exceptional (               z               ‐score = 18–48) TC‐PB induced by category‐1 Cyclone Oma near the South Pacific island of Vanuatu in February 2019, the most extreme event in the observed satellite record of South Pacific surface Chlorophyll‐               a               (Chl‐               a               ). Examining all 156 South Pacific TC since 1997, we identify a “hover” parameter derivable from storm track data correlated with post‐TC surface Chl‐               a               (               r                = 0.84). Using a data set of synthetic storm tracks, we show revisit times for South Pacific TC‐PBs are O(250) years and O(1,500) years for Oma‐scale TC‐PBs. The episodic, extreme, but consistent nature of such events means they may imprint on sediment records. If so, we show their signature could be used to reconstruct past TC variability assuming near‐stationarity of TC statistics.                        ,              Plain Language Summary                            We demonstrate that a relatively weak Tropical Cyclone, Oma, produced the most extreme primary production event observed in the South Pacific satellite record of surface Chlorophyll‐               a               . We examined all 156 South Pacific tropical cyclones since 1997—finding 15 storms had blooms in their wake, although none compared to the response in the wake of Oma. Phytoplankton blooms require specific conditions for formation, namely that they “hover” in place over a long enough period of time, so that wind‐driven upwelling of nutrient‐rich deep water can enter the sunlit surface layers of the ocean and promote photosynthesis. We can characterize the “hovering” of cyclones using a simple parameter derived from location data alone, and so we examine a 10,000‐year synthetic data set of 96,000 South Pacific tropical cyclone tracks to explore the recurrence period of these blooms in current climate. We find that Oma‐type blooms recur only once in 1,500–2,000 years. If biological material from these extreme events reaches the sea floor, the rare but consistent nature of such blooms may be visible in the sedimentary record and help constrain past variability in tropical cyclones.                        ,              Key Points                                                                                     An extreme (σ > 18) surface Chlorophyll‐                     a                     event was observed following Tropical Cyclone Oma passing near Vanuatu in 2019                                                                        South Pacific chlorophyll response is correlated to a “hover” parameter derivable from storm track data alone                                                     Oma‐sized blooms recur on millennial and longer timescales, and may imprint on the sedimentary record",16/03/2023,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 1:04,15/04/2024 5:40,e2022GL100821,,5,50,,Geophysical Research Letters,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has a total installed capacity of 700MWe and more than 180 production and injection wells have been drilled over its more than 30 years of production life. Several numerical models have been developed in the past for use in managing the production in the field. The recent numerical model has been updated with significant enhancements of previous models. The model now uses a more efficient grid system with a finer grid resolution. It also includes the implementation of dual porosity and automated model calibration. The model is presently in the calibration stage. Significant progress in calibration has been accomplished in the past months and the model is now in a satisfactory state for use in prediction of future reservoir response.

The experience to date shows that, if well designed, emissions trading systems (ETS) can be an effective, credible, and transparent tool for helping to achieve low-cost emissions reductions in ways that mobilize private sector actors, attract investment, and encourage international cooperation. However, to maximize effectiveness, any ETS needs to be designed in a way that is appropriate to its context. This Handbook is intended to help decision makers, policy practitioners, and stakeholders achieve this goal. It explains the rationale for an ETS, and sets out a 10-step process for designing an ETS – each step involves a series of decisions or actions that will shape major features of the policy. In doing so, it draws both on conceptual analysis and on some of the most important practical lessons learned to date from implementing ETSs around the world, including from the European Union, several provinces and cities in China, California and Québec, the Northeastern United States, Alberta, New Zealand, Kazakhstan, the Republic of Korea, Tokyo, and Saitama.",7/03/2016,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,,,,,,,Emissions Trading in Practice,,,,,,,,,,,,ResearchGate,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\TDTT5RY5\Kerr et al. - 2016 - Emissions Trading in Practice A Handbook on Desig.pdf; ,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319477510_Emissions_Trading_in_Practice_A_Handbook_on_Design_and_Implementation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We estimate that the average skill of workers declined by 1.8% over the period, reflecting strong employment growth for workers with lower than average skill levels. The net decline was the combined effect of a 3.6% decline in unobserved skill outweighing a 1.8% increase in observed skill, resulting in 1.8% slower estimated skill-adjusted labour growth (13.3%) than the 15.0% growth in full-time equivalent (FTE) employment. Mirroring the skill-dilution, skill-adjusted mfp growth averaged 0.24% per annum over the period compared to 0.14% pa for unadjusted growth. The patterns were stronger over the pre-GFC period to 2008, during which adjusted and unadjusted mfp grew 0.57% pa and 0.42% pa respectively. Our analysis of the effect of changing skill on mfp growth finds that the impact of skill adjustment was almost entirely due to changing skill composition within continuing firms.",2015,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,53,,,,,,,,,,,Motu,,en,,Working Paper,,,Zotero,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\JVQYZZ24\Maré and Hyslop - Firm Productivity Growth and Skill.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because different types of impacts are fundamentally non-commensurable, it is not possible to derive a single composite metric of all research impacts that would be useful for decision purposes. Further, for some important impacts there may be no meaningful quantitative measure, or there may only exist metrics that are illustrative or indicative of the impact in some approximate way. Any evaluation that excluded those impacts that cannot be directly quantified would be biased. For these reasons, the approach of this paper is to identify a set of metrics and indicators that broadly covers the major categories of impacts. In each case, metrics are proposed that come as close as possible to direct quantification of the impact of interest, but where indirect or approximate indicators are the only ones available for potentially important impacts, they are included. The report addresses a number of cross-cutting issues that arise in any attempt to evaluate the long-run impacts of research. These include: the need to distinguish between true objectives and intermediate outcomes, the need to distinguish between the impact of a particular investment and benefits that would have occurred anyway (the “treatment effect”), the long and uncertainty delay between research and its impacts, irreducible uncertainty about impacts, and the question of whether an attempt should be made to measure all impacts in monetary terms. Although these problems cannot be truly solved, the report suggests approaches for dealing with them.",2015,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,13/06/2022 5:13,,,,,,,,,,,,Motu,,en,,Working Paper,,,,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\FPIP9Q4N\a-framework-for-evaluating-the-beneficial-impacts-of-publicly-funded-research.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present an experimental setup for water stable isotope (δ18O and δD) continuous-flow measurements and provide metrics defining the performance of the setup during a major ice core measurement campaign (Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution; RICE). We also use the metrics to compare alternate systems. Our setup is the first continuous-flow laser spectroscopy system that is using off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy (OA-ICOS; analyzer manufactured by Los Gatos Research, LGR) in combination with an evaporation unit to continuously analyze water samples from an ice core.  A Water Vapor Isotope Standard Source (WVISS) calibration unit, manufactured by LGR, was modified to (1) enable measurements on several water standards, (2) increase the temporal resolution by reducing the response time and (3) reduce the influence from memory effects. While this setup was designed for the continuous-flow analysis (CFA) of ice cores, it can also continuously analyze other liquid or vapor sources.  The custom setups provide a shorter response time (~ 54 and 18 s for 2013 and 2014 setup, respectively) compared to the original WVISS unit (~ 62 s), which is an improvement in measurement resolution. Another improvement compared to the original WVISS is that the custom setups have a reduced memory effect.  Stability tests comparing the custom and WVISS setups were performed and Allan deviations (σAllan) were calculated to determine precision at different averaging times. For the custom 2013 setup the precision after integration times of 103 s is 0.060 and 0.070 ‰ for δ18O and δD, respectively. The corresponding σAllan values for the custom 2014 setup are 0.030, 0.060 and 0.043 ‰ for δ18O, δD and δ17O, respectively. For the WVISS setup the precision is 0.035, 0.070 and 0.042 ‰ after 103 s for δ18O, δD and δ17O, respectively. Both the custom setups and WVISS setup are influenced by instrumental drift with δ18O being more drift sensitive than δD. The σAllan values for δ18O are 0.30 and 0.18 ‰ for the custom 2013 and WVISS setup, respectively, after averaging times of 104 s (2.78 h). Using response time tests and stability tests, we show that the custom setups are more responsive (shorter response time), whereas the University of Copenhagen (UC) setup is more stable. More broadly, comparisons of different setups address the challenge of integrating vaporizer/spectrometer isotope measurement systems into a CFA campaign with many other analytical instruments.",17/07/2015,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,13/06/2022 0:37,2869-2883,,7,8,,Atmos.

The mosaic block structure of admixed genomes can provide information about past contact events, including the time and extent of admixture. Here, we describe an improved wavelet-based technique that better characterizes ancestry block structure from observed genomic patterns. principal components analysis is first applied to genomic data to identify the primary population structure, followed by wavelet decomposition to develop a new characterization of local ancestry information along the chromosomes. For testing purposes, this method is applied to human genome-wide genotype data from Indonesia, as well as virtual genetic data generated using genome-scale sequential coalescent simulations under a wide range of admixture scenarios. Time of admixture is inferred using an approximate Bayesian computation framework, providing robust estimates of both admixture times and their associated levels of uncertainty.

Interactions occurring at the level of individual cells may lead to the development of spatial structure which will affect the dynamics of migrating cells at a population level. Models that try to predict population-level behaviour often take a mean-field approach, which assumes that individuals interact with one another in proportion to their average density and ignores the presence of any small-scale spatial structure. In this work, we develop a lattice-free individual-based model (IBM) that uses random walk theory to model the stochastic interactions occurring at the scale of individual migrating cells. We incorporate a mechanism for local directional bias such that an individual's direction of movement is dependent on the degree of cell crowding in its neighbourhood. As an alternative to the mean-field approach, we also employ spatial moment theory to develop a population-level model which accounts for spatial structure and predicts how these individual-level interactions propagate to the scale of the whole population. The IBM is used to derive an equation for dynamics of the second spatial moment (the average density of pairs of cells) which incorporates the neighbour-dependent directional bias, and we solve this numerically for a spatially homogeneous case.",2015-05,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,13/06/2022 0:37,20150228,,106,12,,J.

We have used dates from hydrated obsidian artifacts recovered from habitation sites as a proxy for land use over time. The analysis suggests region-specific dynamics that include the abandonment of leeward and interior locations. These temporal land-use patterns correlate with rainfall variation and soil quality. This analysis demonstrates that the concept of “collapse” is a misleading characterization of prehistoric human population dynamics. As a result, we see our approach as useful in the study of other prehistoric societies for which a sudden demographic collapse has been proposed in prehistory.           ,              Many researchers believe that prehistoric Rapa Nui society collapsed because of centuries of unchecked population growth within a fragile environment. Recently, the notion of societal collapse has been questioned with the suggestion that extreme societal and demographic change occurred only after European contact in AD 1722. Establishing the veracity of demographic dynamics has been hindered by the lack of empirical evidence and the inability to establish a precise chronological framework. We use chronometric dates from hydrated obsidian artifacts recovered from habitation sites in regional study areas to evaluate regional land-use within Rapa Nui. The analysis suggests region-specific dynamics including precontact land use decline in some near-coastal and upland areas and postcontact increases and subsequent declines in other coastal locations. These temporal land-use patterns correlate with rainfall variation and soil quality, with poorer environmental locations declining earlier. This analysis confirms that the intensity of land use decreased substantially in some areas of the island before European contact.",27/01/2015,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,13/06/2022 0:37,1025-1030,,4,112,,Proc.

MELC models child development from birth through to age 13, encompassing changes in material and family circumstances, family functioning and early education. MELC focusses on three main outcomes: health service use, early literacy, and conduct problems. A synthetic base population (n=10,000) derived from the 2006 New Zealand Census is used, and transitions through the life-course are determined from estimates derived by analysing three New Zealand child cohort studies: the Christchurch Health and Development Study, the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, and the Pacific Islands Families Study. The model has been validated against New Zealand norms for reading, general practitioner visits and hospital admissions. Three scenarios were demonstrated. First, we tested the impact of a number of putatively important factors on early literacy, and found small effects. Second, we found that halving the prevalence of single parenting reduced the prevalence of conduct problems. Third, we changed a number of material and family factors for Maori, Pacific and low-socio-economic groups to be equal to those for the general population, and found that this produced small improvements in reading, but large reductions in conduct problems for these groups. MELC has been deployed as a user friendly desktop application at a number of New Zealand government agencies, where it can be used to test policy-relevant scenarios.",1/01/2016,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,28-60,,,8,,International Journal of Microsimulation,Modelling the Early life-course (MELC),,,,,,,,,,,,ResearchGate,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter-Davis-4/publication/311927996_Modelling_the_Early_life-course_MELC_A_Microsimulation_Model_of_Child_Development_in_New_Zealand/links/5f2e7677299bf13404adc2a0/Modelling-the-Early-life-course-MELC-A-Microsimulation-Model-of-Child-Development-in-New-Zealand.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, they are often in a state of flux, with new observations, discoveries and changes in our conceptual understanding leading to the birth and death of categories, drift in their identities, as well as merging or splitting. Contemporary research tools rarely support such changes in operationalized categories, neglecting the problem of capturing and utilizing the knowledge lurking behind the process of change. This paper presents a tool – AdvoCate1 – that represents the dynamic nature of categories. It allows category evolution to be modelled, while maintaining a category versioning system that captures all the different versions of a category, along with the process of its exploration and evolution through use. This helps us to better understand and communicate different versions of categories and the reasons and decisions behind any changes they undergo. We demonstrate the usefulness of AdvoCate using examples of category evolution from a land cover mapping exercise.",2015-08,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,1-Nov,,,,,,Adventures of Categories,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\HVBVCJPW\7304070.html,,,category evolution; category versioning system; Computational modeling; Data models; Databases; Evolution (biology); exploration path; Ontologies; process of science; scientific workflow; Taxonomy; Training,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015 IEEE 11th International Conference on e-Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dynamic materialization of elite management of agricultural production has been documented in the leeward Kohala field system (LKFS) by analysing the spatial distribution of agricultural alignments, trails, and the division and realignment of traditional community-based land units (ahupua‘a). Additional studies have documented the spatial expressions and significance of religious structures (heiau) in relation to these land-units. In this analysis we build on these previous studies by investigating the inter-visibility of heiau. We document shifts in the construction of heiau whereby decreases in the number of structures through time led to a concomitant increase in size and total viewshed breadth. Newly constructed heiau were built to command large viewsheds while taking into account the location and views of pre-existing religious features.

The parameters that drive the data generation process are often estimated by statistical models, such as linear regression models. There are many models that could be considered for this purpose. We compare six potential models, discuss the assumptions of these models, and perform an empirical assessment that compares synthetic data simulated from these models with observed data. We chose six regression-style models that can be easily implemented in standard statistical software: an ordinary least squares regression model with a lagged dependent variable, two random effects models (with and without an autoregressive order 1within-unit error structure), a fixed effects model, a hybrid model combining features from both fixed and random effects models, and a dynamic panel model estimated with system generalised method of moments. The criterion for good performance was the proximity of fit of simulated data to the observed data on various characteristics. We found evidence of violated assumptions in our data for all the models but found that, for the majority of data characteristics assessed, all the models produced synthetic data that were a reasonable approximation to the observed data, with some models performing better or worse for particular characteristics. We hope more modellers will consider and test the assumptions of models used for parameter estimation and experiment with different model specifications resulting in higher quality microsimulation models and other research applications.",1/01/2016,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,83-127,,,8,,International Journal of Microsimulation,Regression-Style Models for Parameter Estimation in Dynamic Microsimulation,,,,,,,,,,,,ResearchGate,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter-Davis-4/publication/311928191_Regression-Style_Models_for_Parameter_Estimation_in_Dynamic_Microsimulation_An_Empirical_Performance_Assessment/links/5f2e7677a6fdcccc43b32661/Regression-Style-Models-for-Parameter-Estimation-in-Dynamic-Microsimulation-An-Empirical-Performance-Assessment.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are important for parameterizing numerical models, automatic history matching and uncertainty quantification of model predictions. However, the current way of evaluating model sensitivities using finite differencing does not scale well for large and highly nonlinear geothermal reservoir simulations. Alternatively model sensitivities may be generated by solving related linear problems forward or backward in time. The method of choice depends on the dimensionality of the parameter and observation spaces. The proposed linear methods were tested on one-dimensional transient two-phase flow problems, solved using the TOUGH2 simulator. Results of the forward and backward propagating methods were compared with those found by using simple, but computationally expensive, finite differencing.",18/11/2015,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ResearchGate,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elvar-Bjarkason/publication/298361529_Improved_sensitivity_calculations/links/5930fc4da6fdcc89e787864e/Improved-sensitivity-calculations.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,37th New Zealand Geothermal Workshop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is renowned for its abundance of natural geothermal manifestations including the geysers and hot springs at Whakarewarewa. Intensive extraction of the geothermal fluid in the 1970s led to a general decline of the activity of the surface features. In 1982 an extensive Monitoring Programme was initiated to provide insight into the system behaviour and response to geothermal production. Its conclusions led to the 1986 Wellbore Closure Programme that resulted in the recovery of reservoir pressures and many of the surface features. The monitoring programme continues through to the current day and efforts to provide a robust numerical model of the geothermal aquifer and surface features are ongoing.

Sedimentary charcoal and fossil remains indicate how frequent burning and perennial cultivation overcame the ecological constraints for taro production, particularly the temperate forest cover of New Zealand. An increase in short-lived plants, indicating a transition toward higher-intensity production, followed rapid woody forest decline and species extinctions on all islands. The relatively recent fossil records from the subtropical and temperate islands of Polynesia provide unique insights into the ecological processes behind the spread of Neolithic crops into areas marginal for production.                        ,                             Polynesians introduced the tropical crop taro (               Colocasia esculenta               ) to temperate New Zealand after 1280 CE, but evidence for its cultivation is limited. This contrasts with the abundant evidence for big game hunting, raising longstanding questions of the initial economic and ecological importance of crop production. Here we compare fossil data from wetland sedimentary deposits indicative of taro and leaf vegetable (including               Sonchus               and               Rorippa               spp.) cultivation from Ahuahu, a northern New Zealand offshore island, with Raivavae and Rapa, both subtropical islands in French Polynesia. Preservation of taro pollen on all islands between 1300 CE and 1550 CE indicates perennial cultivation over multiple growing seasons, as plants rarely flower when frequently harvested. The pollen cooccurs with previously undetected fossil remains of extinct trees, as well as many weeds and commensal invertebrates common to tropical Polynesian gardens. Sedimentary charcoal and charred plant remains show that fire use rapidly reduced forest cover, particularly on Ahuahu. Fires were less frequent by 1500 CE on all islands as forest cover diminished, and short-lived plants increased, indicating higher-intensity production. The northern offshore islands of New Zealand were likely preferred sites for early gardens where taro production was briefly attempted, before being supplanted by sweet potato (               Ipomoea batatas               ), a more temperate climate-adapted crop, which was later established in large-scale cultivation systems on the mainland after 1500 CE.",30/04/2019,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,17/06/2022 1:18,8824-8833,,18,116,,Proc.

Unlike the acute, high morbidity infections typical in spillover hosts, infected reservoir hosts often exhibit low morbidity and mortality. Although it has been proposed that reservoir host infections may be persistent with recurrent episodes of shedding, direct evidence is often lacking. We construct a generalized SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) framework encompassing 46 sub-models representing the full range of possible transitions among those four states of infection and immunity. We then use likelihood-based methods to fit these models to nine years of longitudinal data on henipavirus serology from a captive colony of               Eidolon helvum               bats in Ghana. We find that reinfection is necessary to explain observed dynamics; that acute infectious periods may be very short (hours to days); that immunity, if present, lasts about 1–2 years; and that recurring latent infection is likely. Although quantitative inference is sensitive to assumptions about serology, qualitative predictions are robust. Our novel approach helps clarify mechanisms of viral persistence and circulation in wild bats, including estimated ranges for key parameters such as the basic reproduction number and the duration of the infectious period. Our results inform how future field-based and experimental work could differentiate the processes of viral recurrence and reinfection in reservoir hosts.

Our research suggests that EOC activities are under-valued and often designed based on personal instinct rather than strategic planning, but that there is also a lack of accessible tools that support a more strategic design process. We propose three foci for increasing the professionalisation of practitioner approaches to EOC: (1) improved articulation of goals and objectives; (2) acknowledgement of different drivers, voices and power structures; and (3) increased practical training, resources and reporting structures. We respond to this by proposing a framework for planning and design of public engagement that provides an opportunity to become more transparent and explicit about the real goals of an activity and what “success” looks like.

Here we investigate the extent to which Antarctica's wilderness encompasses its biodiversity. We assembled a comprehensive record of human activity on the continent (~ 2.7 million localities) and used it to identify unvisited areas ≥ 10 000 km2 (i.e. Antarctica's wilderness areas) and their representation of biodiversity. We show that, at best, 7 770 000 km2 of wilderness remains, covering 56.9% of the continent's surface area, however it captures few important biodiversity features. Important Bird Areas, ice-free Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Regions crucial for biodiversity and areas with verified biodiversity records are largely excluded.

In this article, we consider the alternative possibility that in some cases, signal delay can be used functionally, that is, as an essential component of a cognitive system. To investigate this idea, we evolve a minimal robot controller to solve a basic stimulus-distinction task. The controller is constrained so that the solution must utilize a delayed recurrent signal. Different from previous evolutionary robotics studies, our controller is modeled using delay differential equations, which (unlike the ordinary differential equations of conventional continuous-time recurrent neural networks) can accurately capture delays in signal propagation. We analyze the evolved controller and its interaction with its environment using classical dynamical systems techniques. The analysis shows what kinds of invariant sets underlie the various successful and unsuccessful performances of the robot, and what kinds of bifurcations produce these invariant sets. In the second phase of our analysis, we turn our attention to the parameter θ, which describes the amount of signal delay included in the model. We show how the delay destabilizes certain attractors that would exist if there were no delay and creates other stable attractors, resulting in an agent that performs well at the target task.",2019-11,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,17/06/2022 1:18,315-333,,4,25,,Artificial Life,Can Signal Delay be Functional?,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\AY8MBFED\Egbert et al. - 2019 - Can Signal Delay be Functional Including Delay in.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it has been largely excluded from the human genomics sequencing boom of the last decade. To serve as a benchmark dataset of molecular phenotypes across the region, we generated genome-wide CpG methylation and gene expression measurements in over 100 individuals from three locations that capture the major genomic and geographical axes of diversity across the Indonesian archipelago. Investigating between- and within-island differences, we find up to 10% of tested genes are differentially expressed between the islands of Mentawai (Sumatra) and New Guinea. Variation in gene expression is closely associated with DNA methylation, with expression levels of 9.7% of genes strongly correlating with nearby CpG methylation, and many of these genes being differentially expressed between islands. Genes identified in our differential expression and methylation analyses are enriched in pathways involved in immunity, highlighting Indonesia tropical role as a source of infectious disease diversity and the strong selective pressures these diseases have exerted on humans. Finally, we identify robust within-island variation in DNA methylation and gene expression, likely driven by very local environmental differences across sampling sites. Together, these results strongly suggest complex relationships between DNA methylation, transcription, archaic hominin introgression and immunity, all jointly shaped by the environment. This has implications for the application of genomic medicine, both in critically understudied Indonesia and globally, and will allow a better understanding of the interacting roles of genomic and environmental factors shaping molecular and complex phenotypes.",16/07/2019,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,17/06/2022 1:18,,,,,,,,,,,,Genomics,,en,,preprint,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,DOI: 10.1101/704304,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\EJXSCPKE\Natri et al. - 2019 - Genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression pa.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the link between genetic demography inferred at large scales and the individual human behaviours that ultimately generate that demography is not always clear. While anthropological and historical context are routinely presented as adjuncts in population genetic studies to help describe the past, determining how underlying patterns of human sociocultural behaviour impact genetics still remains challenging. Here, we analyse patterns of genetic variation in village-scale samples from two islands in eastern Indonesia, patrilocal Sumba and a matrilocal region of Timor. Adopting a ‘process modelling’ approach, we iteratively explore combinations of structurally different models as a thinking tool. We find interconnected socio-genetic interactions involving sex-biased migration, lineage-focused founder effects, and on Sumba, heritable social dominance. Strikingly, founder ideology, a cultural model derived from anthropological and archaeological studies at larger regional scales, has both its origins and impact at the scale of villages. Process modelling lets us explore these complex interactions, first by circumventing the complexity of formal inference when studying large datasets with many interacting parts, and then by explicitly testing complex anthropological hypotheses about sociocultural behaviour from a more familiar population genetic standpoint.",2019-08,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,17/06/2022 1:18,190733,,8,6,,R.

Translating the results of these studies to inform prevention, detection, and response efforts often can be challenging, especially if prior relationships and communications have not been established with decision-makers. Whatever scientific information is shared with decision-makers before, during, and after public health emergencies is highly dependent on the individuals or organizations who are communicating with policy-makers. This article briefly describes the landscape of stakeholders involved in information-sharing before and during emergencies. We identify critical gaps in translation of scientific expertise and results, and biosafety and biosecurity measures to public health policy and practice with a focus on One Health and zoonotic diseases. Finally, we conclude by exploring ways of improving communication and funding, both of which help to address the identified gaps.

Several abundant and widely distributed Sigmodontinae rodents are the primary hosts of Orthohantavirus and, in combination with other factors, these rodents can shape hantavirus disease. Here, we assessed the influence of host diversity, climate, social vulnerability and land use change on the risk of hantavirus disease in Brazil over 24 years. Methods: Landscape variables (native forest, forestry, sugarcane, maize and pasture), climate (temperature and precipitation), and host biodiversity (derived through niche models) were used in spatiotemporal models, using the 5570 Brazilian municipalities as units of analysis. Results: Amounts of native forest and sugarcane, combined with temperature, were the most important factors influencing the increase of disease risk. Population at risk (rural workers) and rodent host diversity also had a positive effect on disease risk. Conclusions: Land use change—especially the conversion of native areas to sugarcane fields—can have a significant impact on hantavirus disease risk, likely by promoting the interaction between the people and the infected rodents. Our results demonstrate the importance of understanding the interactions between landscape change, rodent diversity, and hantavirus disease incidence, and suggest that land use policy should consider disease risk. Meanwhile, our risk map can be used to help allocate preventive measures to avoid disease.",31/10/2019,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,17/06/2022 1:18,1008,,11,11,,Viruses,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\DBGVXL7X\Muylaert et al. - 2019 - Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Hantavirus Cardiopulmon.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In te ao Mäori – ancestral Mäori ways of living – rivers and lakes are the tears of Ranginui, the sky father, mourning his separation from Papatüänuku, the earth mother, and people are their descendants, joined in complex whakapapa that link all forms of life together. In modern ways of thinking, on the other hand, ideas such as private property, resource management and ecosystem services can be traced back to the Genesis story of God’s gift of ‘dominion’ to Adam and Eve over fish, birds, plants and the earth itself, including waterways, in which all other life forms are created for human purposes. In successive Waitangi Tribunal claims, iwi have disputed these assumptions in relation to fisheries, tribal lands and rivers, and, in worldleading legislation, the Whanganui River has been declared a legal person with its own rights. In this article, the authors discuss different ways in which the rights of rivers as rivers might be understood in scientific terms, investigating the ‘geomorphic rights’ of the Whanganui River, for instance, and how rivers as living communities of land, water, plants, animals and people might be understood through ‘river ethnography’, an approach that aligns a wide range of natural and social sciences with mätauranga taiao – ancestral knowledge of other living systems. They also consider how current policy discussions might be informed by such framings, so that river communities across Aotearoa New Zealand may be restored to a state of ora – life, health, abundance and prosperity.",26/08/2019,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,17/06/2022 1:18,,,3,15,,pq,Let the Rivers Speak,,,,,,,,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\EEYMPR9T\Salmond et al. - 2019 - Let the Rivers Speak thinking about waterways in .pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It explores how the idea of the social licence of operate (SLO) relates to the tradition of social contract theory. This philosophical detour shows that social licence is less novel and more entrenched in our politics than its critics seem to realise. The paper then turns to how social licence is realised through action and procedure, and why it is resurgent in the national conversation. Finally, I argue that social licence need not be seen as an imposition or inconvenience, but rather an opportunity to create substantive community support for efforts to align the forestry sector toward maximising public value.",2019,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,7,,2,64,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\KXXYUHM8\Hall - 2019 - A state of licence – the social licence to operate.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the case that the function to be learned is multi-valued (so that there are several correct output values for a given input) the problem becomes ill-posed, and many standard methods fail to find good solutions. However, optimisation problems based on multi-valued functions are relatively common. They include reverse robot kinematics, and the research field of AutoML – which is becoming increasingly popular – where one seeks to establish optimal hyperparameters for a learning algorithm for a particular problem based on loss function values for trained networks, or to reuse training from previous networks.

Yet, applying these methods at national scale to verify and improve the National Inventory Report (NIR) and support the Paris agreement remains at the frontier of CO2 science. We will present results from CarbonWatch-NZ, a national atmospheric inverse model developed for New Zealand. Our inverse approach infers net air-sea and air-land CO2 fluxes from measurement records, using back-trajectory simulations from the Numerical Atmospheric dispersion Modelling Environment (NAME) Lagrangian dispersion model, driven by meteorology from the New Zealand Limited Area Model (NZLAM) weather prediction model, which is run at 1.5 and 12km resolutions. Our first results are based on in situ measurements from two fixed sites, Baring Head on the southern tip of New Zealand's North Island (41.41°S, 174.87°E) and Lauder from the central South Island (45.034°S, 169.68°E), and ship board data from monthly cruises between Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. We also show results that include our newest site, Maunga Kākaramea in the central North Island (38.33°S, 176.38°E) for the period when data is available for all three in situ sites (2012-2017). A range of scenarios is used to assess the sensitivity of the inversion method to underlying assumptions and to ensure robustness of the results. We find that the National Inventory Report may under-estimate New Zealand's land carbon uptake by 30-60%, when differences between the total uptake observed by the atmosphere and accounting rules of the NIR are considered. Much of this additional uptake occurs in the southwest of New Zealand's South Island, an unihabited region dominated by indigenous forests. First analysis of 13C isotope ratios in CO2 confirms the presence of a vigorous land-based carbon sink in this region. This carbon sink is characterised by strong interannual variability, and suggests an unexpectedly strong response of New Zealand's land carbon sink to drought stress. Observations from our newest observing site in the central North Island shed new light on carbon fluxes in this subtropical region.",1/04/2019,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,17/06/2022 5:55,4527,,,,,,National scale carbon dioxide inverse modelling,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2019EGUGA..21.4527M,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,European Geosciences Union General Assembly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under such assumption, this research focuses on DG's internal control schemes and cooperation in order to maintain microgrid's continuous operation. A cooperative secondary frequency controller is proposed in a hierarchical DG control structure. By sharing information between DGs, the proposed controller will generate a compensator into secondary control so that the output frequency can be restored.

It is possible that their crucial role in transmitting traditional knowledge and practices may sustain wellbeing through strong social networks and a sense of purpose and value. Our programme of qualitative research aims to highlight kaumātua voices in the search for pathways towards fostering wellbeing and remediating health inequities. For a feasibility study, our seven member team (Māori, with one exception) met with kaumātua from two localities to plan noho wānanga, intensive meetings to exchange knowledge and ideas. The wānanga, held over a 24 hour period, involved focus group style sessions, interviews in pairs and shared meals. Kaumātua appreciated the opportunity to talk about ageing well and the study demonstrated that our innovative approach sits well amongst the tools of kaupapa Māori methodology (research methods designed by and for Māori). The data were analysed with NVivo, showing that kaumātua understood health and wellbeing holistically and historically, showed less interest in their own health than we expected and were dedicated to their roles and to the wellbeing of their communities. With a further grant we explore community responsibility for kaumātua health and wellbeing.

In this scenario, the problem of detecting anomalies is intensified. In the literature, offline methods see more data and can be optimised to achieve lower false positive rates. However, they cannot readily adapt to changing network conditions or capture concept-drift. This necessitates an incremental online learning model. On the other hand, online training is easily affected by noise. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Online Offline system in which the Offline model retains general characteristics of network traffic while the Online model continuously learns. The Offline model acts as a bias for the Online model to select new data to learn from. The Online model retains its knowledge and adapts to the changing ground truth. They are put to work together to detect anomalies. We implement this idea with an Online Support Vector Machine (SVM) which retains its support vectors and shifts its decision boundary guided by an Offline Radius Nearest Neighbor (Rad-NN). The method is evaluated on the NSL-KDD 2009 dataset. This relatively simple model achieves over 95% accuracy on known anomalies and over 60% detection rate on most of the unknown anomalies.",2019-07,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,1-Sept,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,ISSN: 2637-9430,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\QA4WRWE9\8847011.html,,,Data models; Training; Adaptation models; Anomaly detection; Feature extraction; Machine learning; Support vector machines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019 28th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the New Zealand 2012 Performance Based Research Fund (PBRF) round shows that men graded A and B in the PBRF are three times more likely to be professor than women with the same PBRF grade (in press, Brower & Menclova). The data from the following PBRF round in 2018 are yet to be released. However, publication of 2017 data on the shape of the tertiary education sector workforce show that women comprise 50 percent of the academic cohort but only 26 percent of all professors and Deans from the eight New Zealand universities (2018, Ministry of Education). The New Zealand university sector is a relatively strong higher education sector, with several of the universities and their associated faculties historically featuring in various global metrics and rankings, but the sector is yet to embrace gender equity. Our research focuses on the lived realities of this iniquitous landscape through the stories of senior academic women. The paper draws on interviews undertaken by the authors in a comparative project on women in academic leadership and management positions in Denmark and New Zealand. The focus in this paper is on the New Zealand interviews that were conducted from 2016 and 2018 with ten women in positions of academic leadership at three of the eight universities in the North and South Islands. The interviewees comprised four Associate Professors and six professors. Of the six professors, at the time of the interviews, two were Head of School, one was a Pro-Vice Chancellor, and one was the head of a research institute. Our analysis of these interviews showed some weaknesses in solely intersectional or structural ways to explain the gendered university. Instead, we opt for the metaphor of a fugue in which structure and agency, intersectionality and structuration, individual identity and group characteristics work in polyphony in ways that both shape academic career trajectories and are ‘played’ by the women themselves. The intention of the paper is to outline our methodological approach with the fugue and to draw attention to four ‘themes’ drawn from our interviewees that we see as critical in the complex and polyphonous context of women’s academic lives as they seek to make value in a landscape laden with structural challenges and individual potentiality.",2019,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,17/06/2022 5:15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\4PSDTGSN\49465.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Annual Conference for The European Conference Education Research (ECER),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is guided by five principles – recognition, reparation, redistribution, reimagination and recreation – which respectively involve recognising the systemic causes of environmental crisis, repairing the harms done to ecosystems and communities, redistributing flows to mitigate further harm, reimagining humanity’s relationships to its environments, and recreating the future of work to enrich social and environmental value. This paper uses Moore and Patel’s framework to ‘make sense’ of the Living Laboratories project, an ecological restoration project in Aotearoa New Zealand which the author and others have established through a partnership between AUT University and indigenous tribe Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei. In particular, the reparation ecology framework (REF) will be contrasted with the natural capital framework (NCF), an increasingly popular economic logic for conceiving of the value of ecological restoration (e.g. Helm, 2016; Cohen et al., 2017). I will argue that the REF is more practically useful than NCF for the Living Laboratories case study, which has implications for upscaling such projects nationally and internationally, where partnerships involve indigenous groups or local communities. I will also critically analyse whether the REF fulfils its own commitment to recognition by not displacing tikanga Māori through the imposition of a general framework.",2019,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019 New Zealand Political Studies Association (NZPSA) Annual Conference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RVLHFN6H,conferencePaper,2019,"Hall, David",The Christchurch Principles: A democratic framework for reducing harmful online content,2019 New Zealand Political Studies Association (NZPSA) Annual Conference,,,,,"The Christchurch mosque attacks on 15 March 2019 crystallised growing concerns about the role of digital technologies in driving, enabling and empowering violent extremism. The Christchurch Principles address these concerns by proposing a set of regulative principles to articulate and mitigate the threats to human rights and democratic institutions posed by harmful online content. Taking the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) as a starting point, the Christchurch Principles articulate the various responsibilities of states, business and civil society actors to protect and respect human rights and democratic institutions, and to remedy their degradation. By extending the UNGPs’ framework of Protect-Respect-Remedy beyond human rights to include democratic institutions, the Christchurch Principles offers a democratic model that recognises that it isn’t sufficient to merely protect canonical rights, but also to support democratic norms, sentiments and practices that create the most favourable conditions for human rights to flourish. These Principles were co-designed by the Helen Clark Foundation, The Policy Observatory, The Workshop, and other stakeholders to present to the Paris Peace Forum on 11-13th November 2019.",2019,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019 New Zealand Political Studies Association (NZPSA) Annual Conference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We co-create its political, economic and social systems on a daily basis. Each of us has a particular view of Aotearoa, yet nobody comprehends the whole. This book's sets of maps and graphics help New Zealanders make sense of their country, to grasp the scale, diversity and intricacies of Aotearoa, and to experience feelings of connection to land, to place, to this time in our history, and to one another. By making data visible, each graphic reveals insights about Aotearoa. They answer a range of questions: Who visits us? How many fish are in the sea? How equal are we? How do we hurt ourselves? Where do our cats go to at night? This compelling mixture of charts, graphs, diagrams, maps and illustrations is functional, beautiful, insightful and enlightening.

We undertook the exercise to identify whether New Zealand’s towns and rural centres are following their international counterparts in declining from what is proposed as a ‘new’ and increasingly intractable form of population decline, where net migration loss is accompanied by natural decrease, as opposed to the ‘old’ form where natural increase is positive but fails to offset net migration loss. We also examined whether ‘age-selective migration’, as in the migration-driven loss of young people and/or gain of older people, is a major factor driving New Zealand’s subnational structural population ageing. We found that the old form of depopulation, net migration loss, was the major determinant of New Zealand’s subnational depopulation across the period 1976-2013; also that migration was highly age-selective. In the process, it accelerated the structural ageing of the majority of TAs, towns and rural centres. In 2013, 41 per cent of towns and 29 per cent of rural centres had populations with greater than 20 per cent aged 65+ years (compared with just 15 per cent for Total New Zealand); 85 per cent of towns were older with migration than they would have been in the absence of migration, as were two-thirds of rural centres and four-fifths of TAs. We also found the new, ‘dual’ form of depopulation to be present, but as yet affecting a relatively small number of towns and rural centres. However, projections at TA level indicate that the shift to natural decrease and the new form of depopulation will soon escalate, the latter becoming the major cause of depopulation by 2043 and the major cause of population change per se. Overall our analysis confirms that migration is not a panacea for growth. Just 39 per cent of towns, 33 per cent of rural centres, and 26 per cent of TAs were larger in 2013 than 1976 as the result of migration. A further 27 per cent of towns, 17 per cent of rural centres, and 36 per cent of TAs also grew across the period, but were smaller with migration than they would have been in its absence; for them, natural increase played the major role in determining growth. Moreover, we found that migration is negatively correlated with natural increase, and, relatedly, that the proportion of women aged 15-44 years heavily determines natural increase. These findings suggest that areas losing their young, reproductive age population are paying the price of the gains made by other areas.

Stephen Lansing and geneticist Murray Cox have explored dozens of villages on the islands of the Malay Archipelago, combining ethnographic research with research into genetic and linguistic markers to shed light on how these societies change over time. Islands of Order draws on their pioneering fieldwork to show how the science of complexity can be used to better understand unstable dynamics in culture, language, cooperation, and the emergence of hierarchies. Complexity science has opened exciting new vistas in physics and biology, but poses challenges for social scientists. What triggers fundamental, discontinuous social change? And what brings stable patterns-islands of order-into existence? Lansing and Cox begin with an incisive and accessible introduction to models of change, from simple random drift to coupled interactions, phase transitions, co-phylogenies, and adaptive landscapes. Then they take readers on a series of journeys to the islands of the Indo-Pacific to demonstrate how social scientists can harness these powerful tools to discover out-of-equilibrium social dynamics. Lansing and Cox address empirical questions surrounding the colonization of the Pacific, the relationship of language to culture, the emergence and disappearance of male and female hierarchies, and more. Unlocking new possibilities for the social sciences, Islands of Order is accompanied by an interactive companion website that enables readers to explore the models described in the book",2019,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,,1,,,,,Islands of order,Princeton studies in complexity,,,,Princeton University Press,"Princeton, New Jersey",,,,,,Library of Congress ISBN,HM529,,,,,,Mathematical models; Anthropology; Asia; Austronesier; Genetik; Gesellschaftsordnung; Islands of the Pacific; KomplexitaÌ#x88;t; Komplexität; Kulturvergleich; Linguistik; Malay Archipelago; Methodology; Ozeanien; Pacific Ocean; Social structure; Sociology; Sozialwissenschaften; Südostasien; Theoriendynamik; Verwandtschaft,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing well-being by providing more goods and services to consume is a sustainability challenge. There are two opposing schools of thought on the consumption of natural resources: strong sustainability and weak sustainability. Proponents of strong sustainability emphasize the preservation of natural capital in each period because they argue that it cannot be replaced with any other type of capital. By contrast, weak sustainability scholars argue that natural resource can be consumed to build other forms of capital in which case sustainability requires that the aggregated monetised value of all capital stocks is non-declining or preferably increasing over the time. In this paper, we propose to adopt a balanced approach instead of taking either of these extreme positions where critical natural capital (CNC) limits are defined by strong sustainability and, within that limit, substitutability between various types of capital is allowed for economic efficiency and growth in total wealth. In such frameworks, weak sustainability indicates the minimum sustainability requirement for an economy in which all types of capitals are substitutable under the limits of CNC.",29/10/2018,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 9:49,,,,,,,,,,,Working Papers in Economics,University of Waikato,,en,,,,,ideas.repec.org,,Publication Title: Working Papers in Economics,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\Z5QS67E5\Qasim - 2018 - Some Links between Sustainability and Well-Being.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\UDYQCIXI\18-13.html,,,intergenerational well-being; strong sustainability; sustainable development; weak sustainability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18/13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNTXE78N,report,2018,"Qasim, Mubashir; Grimes, Arthur",Sustainable Economic Policy and Well-Being: The Relationship between Adjusted Net Savings and Subjective Well-Being,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3187101,"We analyse the relationship between subjective wellbeing (SWB) and the World Bank’s measure of a country’s economic sustainability, adjusted net savings (ANS). We model SWB at individual level and at aggregated group level as a function of past ANS levels, after controlling for a country’s initial levels of SWB. The empirical models utilise World Values Surveys (WVS) data for self-reported life-satisfaction (our proxy for SWB). Our results show that ANS is negatively associated with future SWB outcomes over relatively short timespans (10-15 years) but this relationship is neutralised, or even reversed, for a longer timespan (20 years). The results demonstrate an important challenge in political economy. Governments that choose to save less in the short term may be able to spend more on the well-being of the current generation (i.e. current voters) but they diminish the reserves available to improve future generations’ well-being. At a more technical level, our results reinforce the concept that ANS is a useful sustainability indicator for infinite (or at least very long) time horizons, but it is not a good indicator of well-being developments over short time horizons.",18/05/2018,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 9:48,,,,,,,Sustainable Economic Policy and Well-Being,,,,,Social Science Research Network,"Rochester, NY",en,,SSRN Scholarly Paper,,,papers.ssrn.com,,DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.3187101,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\NDKCZRHA\Qasim and Grimes - 2018 - Sustainable Economic Policy and Well-Being The Re.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\9GUYH69E\papers.html,,,Adjusted net savings; intergenerational sustainability; subjective wellbeing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3187101,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Educational Assortative Matching and the Distribution of Income in New Zealand,,,,,https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3477044,"Educational assortative matching among couples, i.e. the phenomenon whereby the higheducated have partners who are also high-educated, has gained attention in popular media and academic research as a driver of recent changes in the distribution of household income. We examine the effect of educational assortative matching on the distribution of household income in New Zealand - a country which has experienced rising inequality, increased educational attainment and a relatively low, and falling, wage premium for higher levels of education. Using data from the 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2013 Census of Population and Dwellings and a counterfactual randomisation methodology that accounts for secular changes in the educational distribution, we find that educational assortative matching has increased but, contrary to some evidence overseas, this increase was driven by increased matching in the middle of the educational distribution. Spatially, we find higher and increasing levels of educational assortative matching in metropolitan areas compared to non-metropolitan areas where assortative matching was lower and decreasing. We find that educational assortative matching has had an inequality-increasing impact on the distribution of income, especially for the full-time employed – for whom the matching impact is around 20 percent of the Mean Log Deviation measure of inequality. Additionally, sorting on observable characteristics such as age and location (with the higher educated being disproportionally attracted to the metropolitan areas) are also inequality-increasing and sorting on unobservable characteristics that impact on income can play an important role as well.",2018,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 9:38,,,,,,,Who Partners Up?,,,,,Motu,,en,,Working Paper,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\TMU5U2KS\Alimi et al. - 2018 - Who Partners Up Educational Assortative Matching .pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using theoretically consistent measures derived within the urban economics literature, we compile quality of life and quality of business indicators for 130 ‘cities’ (settlements) from 1976 to 2013, using census rent and wage data. Our analyses both include and exclude the three largest cities (Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch). Places that are attractive to live in tend to be sunny, dry and near water (i.e. the sea or a lake). Since the mid1990s, attractive places have also had relatively high shares of the workforce engaged in education and (to a lesser extent) health. Attractive places have high employment shares in the food, accommodation, arts and recreation service sectors; however (unlike for education and health) we find no evidence that quality of life is related to changes in employment share for these sectors. The quality of business is highest in larger cities, and this relationship is especially strong when the country’s three largest cities are included in the analysis.",2018,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 9:35,,,,,,,,,,,,Motu,,en,,Working Paper,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\7HLHELGF\Preston et al. - 2018 - Amenities and the Attractiveness of New Zealand Ci.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notwithstanding, current advances in translational neuroscience, no ADHD objective, clinically useful, diagnostic marker is available to date. Objectives Using a customized definition of EF and a new clinical paradigm, we performed a prospective diagnostic accuracy trial to assess the diagnostic value of several fractal measures from the thinking processes or inferences in a cohort of ADHD children and typically developing controls. Method We included children from age five to twelve diagnosed with a reference standard based on case history, physical and neurological examination, Conners 3rd Edition, and DSM-V™. The index test consisted of a computer-based inference task with a set of eight different instances of the “Battleships” game to be solved. A consecutive series of 18 cases and 18 controls (n = 36) recruited at the primary paediatrics service from the Nelson Marlborough Health in New Zealand underwent the reference standard and the index test. Several fractal measures were obtained from the inference task to produce supervised classification models. Results Notably, the summarized logistic regression’s predicted probabilities from the eight games played by each children yielded a 100% classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in both a training and an independent testing/validating cohort. Conclusions From a translational vantage point the expeditious method and the robust results make this technique a promising candidate to develop a screening, diagnostic and monitoring system for ADHD, and may serve to assess other EF disturbances.",20/09/2018,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 9:28,420513,,,,,,Predictive Modelling of The Dynamic Patterns of Thinking in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,,,,,bioRxiv,,en,"© 2018, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

We use individual-level administrative data that includes tertiary enrolment information, student allowance receipt, student loan borrowing, and wage earnings to investigate whether the policy affected students’ choices. We use a student’s allowance receipt as an undergraduate or her borrowing for course fees as a postgraduate to proxy for her counterfactual allowance eligibility. We use this proxy to compare allowance-eligible and allowanceineligible students who enter an affected postgraduate qualification or an unaffected Honours degree. Although we are not able to cleanly estimate the causal effect of the policy, our results do not suggest that the policy affected the number or type of postgraduate entrants, their choice between part-time and fulltime study, the amount of paid work they performed while studying, or their rates of dropping out. However, our results strongly suggest that students who became ineligible for allowances increased their student loan borrowing for living expenses.",2018,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,52,,,,,,,,,,,Motu,,en,,Working Paper,,,Zotero,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\2IKKTFUW\18_03.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latent layer is interpreted as a communication channel, the information rate of which is bound by imposing a pre-set signal-to-noise ratio. The new constraint subsumes the mutual information between the input and latent variables, combining naturally with the likelihood objective of the observed data as used in a conventional VAE. The resulting Bounded-Information-Rate Variational Autoencoder (BIR-VAE) provides a meaningful latent representation with an information resolution that can be specified directly in bits by the system designer. The rate constraint can be used to prevent overtraining, and the method naturally facilitates quantisation of the latent variables at the set rate. Our experiments confirm that the BIR-VAE has a meaningful latent representation and that its performance is at least as good as state-of-the-art competing algorithms, but with lower computational complexity.",25/07/2018,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 6:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,"DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.1807.07306 arXiv:1807.07306 [cs, math, stat] type: article","Comment: Presented at KDD 2018 Deep Learning Day.

Devising agricultural management schemes that enhance food security and soil carbon levels is a high priority for many nations. However, the coupling between agricultural productivity, soil carbon stocks and organic matter turnover rates is still unclear. Archived soil samples from four decades of a long-term crop rotation trial were analyzed for soil organic matter (SOM) cycling-relevant properties: C and N content, bulk composition by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, amino sugar content, short-term C bioavailability assays, and long-term C turnover rates by modeling the incorporation of the bomb spike in atmospheric 14C into the soil. After > 40 years under consistent management, topsoil carbon stocks ranged from 14 to 33 Mg C ha−1 and were linearly related to the mean productivity of each treatment. Measurements of SOM composition demonstrated increasing amounts of plant- and microbially derived SOM along the productivity gradient. Under two modeling scenarios, radiocarbon data indicated overall SOM turnover time decreased from 40 to 13 years with increasing productivity – twice the rate of decline predicted from simple steady-state models or static three-pool decay rates of measured C pool distributions. Similarly, the half-life of synthetic root exudates decreased from 30.4 to 21.5 h with increasing productivity, indicating accelerated microbial activity. These findings suggest that there is a direct feedback between accelerated biological activity, carbon cycling rates and rates of carbon stabilization with important implications for how SOM dynamics are represented in models.",4/01/2017,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 2:17,Jan-16,,1,3,,SOIL,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\S46H5BRA\Sanderman et al. - 2017 - Greater soil carbon stocks and faster turnover rat.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While a number of methods specific to bacterial evolution have been developed, none of these permit joint inference of a bacterial recombination graph and associated parameters.

This homogeneity raises the question of whether the patterns of behaviour necessary to account for scale-free social contact networks, where the degree distribution follows a power law, i.e. a few individuals are very highly connected but most have only a few connections, occur in animals, or whether other mechanisms are needed to produce realistic contact network architectures. We develop a space-utilization model for individual animal behaviour to predict the individuals' social contact network. Using basic properties of the               χ               2               distribution we present a simple analytical result that allows the model to give a range of predictions with minimal computational effort.

Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) has been suggested as a supporting tool for management decision-making in order to capture the dynamic complexity of construction projects. However, the limitations of DES in modelling influential factors such as the individual and emergent behaviour of system entities have led to the combined use of Agent-based Simulation (ABS) and DES. This paper provides an overview of DES and ABS applications in construction and then discusses the rationale for integrating DES and ABS from the conceptual stage onwards.

This is because the curvature of the space means that the connection of Riemannian geometry is path dependent. In this paper we transfer the problem to Weitzenbock space, which has torsion, but not curvature, meaning that parallel transport is path independent, and rather than considering geodesics, it is natural to consider autoparallels, which are `straight' in the sense that they follow the local basis vectors. We demonstrate how to generate these autoparallels in a data-driven fashion, and show that the resulting representation of the data is a useful space in which to perform further analysis.",2017-05,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,340-347,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,ISSN: 2161-4407,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\CUIWUP4Y\7965874.html,,,Data analysis; Electronic mail; Extraterrestrial measurements; Geometry; Manifolds; Standards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past 200 years, wargaming has matured into a set of formalized processes. One area of growing interest is the application of agent-based modeling. Agent-based modeling and its additional supporting technologies has potential to introduce a third-generation wargaming capability to the Army, creating a positive overmatch decision-making capability. In its simplest form, agent-based modeling is a computational technique that helps the modeler understand and simulate how the ""whole of a system"" responds to change over time. It provides a decentralized method of looking at situations where individual agents are instantiated within an environment, interact with each other, and empowered to make their own decisions. However, this technology is not without its own risks and limitations. This paper explores a technology roadmap, identifying research topics that could realize agent-based modeling within a tactical wargaming context.",3/05/2017,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 4:18,64-70,,,10207,,,,,,,,SPIE,,,,,,,www.spiedigitallibrary.org,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\WDVYIUNS\12.2266018.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Next-Generation Analyst V,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have demonstrated that the Ca2+-activated Cl- -channel, encoded by the anoctamin1 (Ano1) protein, has a major role in regulating intestinal slow waves and motility. The main aim of this study was to develop a multi-scale mathematical model capable of simulating both normal slow wave entrainment and the effects of Ano1 knockout (KO) on the normal activity. A biophysically-based cell model was adapted to simulate the effects of Ano1 KO at the cellular level. A 10mm one-dimensional (1D) model was then developed to simulate entrained intestinal slow wave propagation. Cellular KO at levels of 100% and 20% were applied to a varying-sized middle region of the 1D model. The main finding was that the level of loss of entrainment increased as both cellular and spatial Ano1 KO levels increased, mostly manifesting as ectopic activation. In the future, this model will be extended and used in combination with Ca2+ -imaging data to quantitatively investigate the effects of Ano1 loss in ICC.",14/09/2017,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 4:12,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE,,,"Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.

The water flows released from reservoirs greatly affect the water temperature of downstream river segments. However, the information of released water flow is often not available for many reservoirs, which makes it difficult for data-driven models to capture the impact to downstream river segments. In this paper, we first build a state-aware graph model to represent the interactions amongst streams and reservoirs, and then propose a parallel learning structure to extract the reservoir release information and use it to improve the prediction. In particular, for reservoirs with no available release information, we mimic the water managers' release decision process through a pseudo-prospective learning method, which infers the release information from anticipated water temperature dynamics. For reservoirs with the release information, we leverage a physics-based model to simulate the water release temperature and transfer such information to guide the learning process for other reservoirs. The evaluation for the Delaware River Basin shows that the proposed method brings over 10% accuracy improvement over existing data-driven models for stream temperature prediction when the release data is not available for any reservoirs. The performance is further improved after we incorporate the release data and physical simulations for a subset of reservoirs.",26/04/2017,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 3:59,405-425,,,,,,Chapter 31,MOS-SIAM Series on Optimization,,,,Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics,,,,,,,epubs.siam.org (Atypon),,DOI: 10.1137/1.9781611974683.ch31,,,,,"derivative-free methodologies; deterministic global optimization; Linear, nonlinear, and conic optimization; robust and stochastic optimization; supply chain design",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In embryogenesis the interplay between calcium signalling and mechanical forces is critical to the healthy development of an embryo but poorly understood. Several types of embryonic cells exhibit calcium-induced contractions and many experiments indicate that calcium signals and contractions are coupled via a two-way mechanochemical feedback mechanism. We present a new analysis of experimental data that supports the existence of this coupling during apical constriction. We then propose a simple mechanochemical model, building on early models that couple calcium dynamics to the cell mechanics and we replace the hypothetical bistable calcium release with modern, experimentally validated calcium dynamics. We assume that the cell is a linear, viscoelastic material and we model the calcium-induced contraction stress with a Hill function, i.e. saturating at high calcium levels. We also express, for the first time, the “stretch-activation” calcium flux in the early mechanochemical models as a bottom-up contribution from stretch-sensitive calcium channels on the cell membrane. We reduce the model to three ordinary differential equations and analyse its bifurcation structure semi-analytically as two bifurcation parameters vary—the $$\textit{IP}_3$$concentration, and the “strength” of stretch activation, $$\lambda $$. The calcium system ($$\lambda =0$$, no mechanics) exhibits relaxation oscillations for a certain range of $$\textit{IP}_3$$values. As $$\lambda $$is increased the range of $$\textit{IP}_3$$values decreases and oscillations eventually vanish at a sufficiently high value of $$\lambda $$. This result agrees with experimental evidence in embryonic cells which also links the loss of calcium oscillations to embryo abnormalities. Furthermore, as $$\lambda $$is increased the oscillation amplitude decreases but the frequency increases. Finally, we also identify the parameter range for oscillations as the mechanical responsiveness factor of the cytosol increases. This work addresses a very important and not well studied question regarding the coupling between chemical and mechanical signalling in embryogenesis.",1/06/2019,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 1:25,2059-2092,,7,78,,J.

In this paper, we use census data to examine how the internal mobility of Māori compares to that of Europeans in New Zealand in the period after these reforms. It is often suggested that Māori are less mobile than other ethnic groups because of attachment to particular geographical locations. If this were the case, Māori may have been disadvantaged in the post-reform period because they were more likely to be living in adversely affected areas and less likely to move to pursue better employment opportunities. In contrast to the anecdotal evidence, we find that Māori are more mobile on average than similar Europeans. However, Māori who live in areas with strong networks of their iwi are slightly less mobile than Europeans. The difference between Māori who live locally to their iwi and those who do not is even more pronounced when we consider responsiveness to local labour market shocks. Non-local Māori are considerably more responsive to changes in economic opportunities than are Europeans, whereas local Māori are almost entirely unresponsive.

Typically, they assume that individuals interact with one another in proportion to their average density (the mean-field assumption) which means that cell–cell interactions occurring over short spatial ranges are not accounted for. However,               in vitro               cell culture studies have shown that spatial correlations can play an important role in determining collective behaviour. Here, we take a combined experimental and modelling approach to explore how individual-level interactions give rise to spatial structure in a moving cell population. Using imaging data from               in vitro               experiments, we quantify the extent of spatial structure in a population of 3T3 fibroblast cells. To understand how this spatial structure arises, we develop a lattice-free individual-based model (IBM) and simulate cell movement in two spatial dimensions. Our model allows an individual’s direction of movement to be affected by interactions with other cells in its neighbourhood, providing insights into how directional bias generates spatial structure. We consider how this behaviour scales up to the population level by using the IBM to derive a continuum description in terms of the dynamics of spatial moments. In particular, we account for spatial correlations between cells by considering dynamics of the second spatial moment (the average density of pairs of cells). Our numerical results suggest that the moment dynamics description can provide a good approximation to averaged simulation results from the underlying IBM. Using our               in vitro               data, we estimate parameters for the model and show that it can generate similar spatial structure to that observed in a 3T3 fibroblast cell population.",15/02/2016,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 1:11,e1689,,,4,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\C5T5RHZ2\Binny et al. - 2016 - Spatial structure arising from neighbour-dependent.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In New Zealand, extensive pest control (~10 million ha) is undertaken to protect native biota and to prevent losses to the primary sector from wildlife vectors of bovine tuberculosis (TB), primarily possums (Trichosurus vulpecula). Control is conducted by TBfree New Zealand and by conservation agencies. Remote, forested terrain is treated using the toxin 1080 via aerial delivery in bait with a return time of ~5 years. Ground-based control is conducted annually using traps and/or poison bait. Possums are controlled to very low abundance by these operations. Aerial 1080 is effective against another forest-dwelling vertebrate pest, the ship rat (Rattus rattus). Possum control has reduced TB rates, but collateral benefits for native biodiversity have not been quantified, making it difficult to demonstrate a return on investment. We review information from 47 accounts of responses of native biota to possum control. Of these, 60% quantified responses to aerial 1080; the remainder were ground-based. Possum control benefited vegetation by increasing foliage and fruit production, and by reducing tree mortality. Controlling ship rats and possums together improved bird populations, but rats recovered rapidly and long-term outcomes for rat-vulnerable birds are unknown.Large-bodied invertebrates also benefited from extensive pest control. We conducted a meta-analysis of 84 response measures from 35 of these 47 studies in order to provide a quantitative assessment of these findings. The analysis demonstrated that both ground and aerial control of this invasive pest in New Zealand has provided substantial collateral benefits for native biota. Few studies have taken advantage of decades of extensive pest control in New Zealand to monitor ecosystem-level outcomes, which have received only short-term attention thus far. Non-treatment experimental controls and replicate sites that enable validated assessments of outcomes for native biota are vital. Future studies would benefit from a standardised set of biodiversity indicators from a range of taxonomic and functional groupings, and from standardising experimental designs so individual studies can contribute to future meta-analyses, to strengthen the evidence base for the impacts of invasive pests on native biota in New Zealand and worldwide.",2016,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 1:11,228,,3,43,,Wildl.

Yet key features of this process remain poorly understood, particularly how social behaviors intersected with demographic drivers to create the patterns of genomic diversity observed across Island Southeast Asia today. Such questions are ripe for computer modeling. Here, we construct an agent-based model to simulate human mobility across Island Southeast Asia from the Neolithic period to the present, with a special focus on interactions between individuals with Asian, Papuan, and mixed Asian–Papuan ancestry. Incorporating key features of the region, including its complex geography (islands and sea), demographic drivers (fecundity and migration), and social behaviors (marriage preferences), the model simultaneously tracks a full suite of genomic markers (autosomes, X chromosome, mitochondrial DNA, and Y chromosome). Using Bayesian inference, model parameters were determined that produce simulations that closely resemble the admixture profiles of 2299 individuals from 84 populations across Island Southeast Asia. The results highlight that greater propensity to migrate and elevated birth rates are related drivers behind the expansion of individuals with Asian ancestry relative to individuals with Papuan ancestry, that offspring preferentially resulted from marriages between Asian women and Papuan men, and that in contrast to current thinking, individuals with Asian ancestry were likely distributed across large parts of western Island Southeast Asia before the Neolithic expansion.",1/12/2016,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 1:11,1495-1506,,4,204,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\E8KK7CK7\Vallée et al. - 2016 - Reconstructing Demography and Social Behavior Duri.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The empirical observations are in agreement with the outcomes of the model containing two interacting species with life histories matching Nile perch and a generalized haplochromine. The dynamic interactions may have depended on size-related differences in early juvenile mortality: mouth-brooding haplochromines escape predation mortality in early life stages, unlike Nile perch, which have miniscule planktonic eggs and larvae. In our model, predation on the latter by planktivorous haplochromine fry acts as a stabilizing factor for co-existence, but external mortality on the haplochromines would disrupt this balance in favor of Nile perch. To explain the observed switch, mortality on haplochromines would need to be much higher than the fishing mortality that can be realistically reconstructed from observations. Abrupt concomitant changes in algal and zooplankton composition, decreased water column transparency, and widespread hypoxia from increased eutrophication most likely caused haplochromine biomass decline. We hypothesize that the shift to Nile perch was a consequence of an externally caused, climate-triggered decrease in haplochromine biomass and associated recruitment failure rather than a direct cause of the introduction.",2016-04,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 1:11,622-643,,4,73,,Can.

BH has been criticized on a number of grounds, including that it would require an infeasible level of micromanagement and enforcement. Recent results from a size-spectrum model show that the distribution of fishing mortality across body sizes that emerges from the behaviour of a large number of fishing agents corresponds to BH in a single species. Size-spectrum models differ from classical size-structured models used in fisheries as they are based on a bookkeeping of biomass transfer from prey to predator rather than a von Bertalanffy growth model. Here we investigate a classical Beverton-Holt model coupled with the Gordon-Schaefer harvesting model extended to allow for differential fishing pressure at different body sizes. This models an open-access fishery in which individual fishing agents act to maximize their own economic return. We show that the equilibrium of the harvesting model produces an aggregate fishing mortality that is closely matched to the production at different body sizes, in other words BH of a single species. These results have significant implications because they show that the robustness of BH does not depend on arguments about the relative production levels of small versus large fish.",1/01/2017,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 1:11,112-120,,1,74,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\KGZ4UMPA\Plank - 2017 - Balanced harvesting is the bioeconomic equilibrium.pdf,,,,"Andersen, Ken",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the fossilized birth–death tree prior and the Lewis-Mk model of discrete morphological evolution allow for the estimation of both divergence times and phylogenetic relationships between fossil and extant taxa. We exploit this statistical framework to investigate the internal consistency of these models by producing phylogenetic estimates of the age of each fossil in turn, within two rich and well-characterized datasets of fossil and extant species (penguins and canids). We find that the estimation accuracy of fossil ages is generally high with credible intervals seldom excluding the true age and median relative error in the two datasets of 5.7% and 13.2%, respectively. The median relative standard error (RSD) was 9.2% and 7.2%, respectively, suggesting good precision, although with some outliers. In fact, in the two datasets we analyse, the phylogenetic estimate of fossil age is on average less than 2 Myr from the mid-point age of the geological strata from which it was excavated. The high level of internal consistency found in our analyses suggests that the Bayesian statistical model employed is an adequate fit for both the geological and morphological data, and provides evidence from real data that the framework used can accurately model the evolution of discrete morphological traits coded from fossil and extant taxa. We anticipate that this approach will have diverse applications beyond divergence time dating, including dating fossils that are temporally unconstrained, testing of the ‘morphological clock', and for uncovering potential model misspecification and/or data errors when controversial phylogenetic hypotheses are obtained based on combined divergence dating analyses.

Intellectual property rights such as patents mitigate, but do not completely solve the problem of firms' inability to appropriate all of the benefits of their innovations.

Clearly written, reasonably priced, with an abundance of expertly formulated practice problems and updated examples, this textbook is essential reading for analyzing and improving all facets of operations. Some of the material in the newest edition has been reorganized. For example, the first chapter introduces service strategy, the product/process matrix and flexible manufacturing systems, benchmarking, the productivity frontier, the innovation curve, and lean production as a strategy. The focus is slightly more international. The analysis of capacity growth planning now appears in the chapter on supply chain analytics. Aggregate planning details were added to chapter 3, including chase and level strategies in an appendix to the chapter. There is an expanded discussion on risk pooling in the chapter on supply chain strategy. The mechanics behind lean production are included in the chapter on push and pull production systems. The chapter on quality and assurance downplays sampling in favor of discussions of quality management, process capability, and the waste elimination side of lean. The separate chapter on facilities layout and location was eliminated and the information redistributed throughout the text. The authors reinforce the learning process through key points at the beginning of each chapter to guide the reader, snapshots that provide useful examples of applications to businesses, and historical notes that provide a context for the topics discussed.

We present a novel method of preserving brittle ice for CFA stable water isotope measurements using data from a new ice core recovered by the Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution (RICE) project. Modest modification of the drilling technique and the accommodation of non-horizontal fractures (‘slanted breaks’) in processing led to a substantial improvement in the percentage of brittle ice analyzed with CFA (87.8%). Whereas traditional processing methods remove entire fragmented pieces of ice, our method allowed the incorporation of a total of 3 m of ice (1% of the 261 m of brittle ice and ~1300 years of climate history) that otherwise would not have been available for CFA. Using the RICE stable water isotope CFA dataset, we demonstrate the effect of slanted breaks and analyze the resulting smoothing of the data with real and simulated examples. Our results suggest that retaining slanted breaks are a promising technique for preserving brittle ice material for CFA stable water isotope measurements.",2018-04,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 6:33,289-299,,244,64,,J.

We describe a systematic approach to the calibration and uncertainty estimation of a high-resolution continuous flow analysis (CFA) water isotope (δ2H, δ18O) record from the Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution (RICE) Antarctic ice core. Our method establishes robust uncertainty estimates for CFA δ2H and δ18O measurements, comparable to those reported for discrete sample δ2H and δ18O analysis. Data were calibrated using a time-weighted two-point linear calibration with two standards measured both before and after continuously melting 3 or 4 m of ice core. The error at each data point was calculated as the quadrature sum of three factors: Allan variance error, scatter over our averaging interval (error of the variance) and calibration error (error of the mean). Final mean total uncertainty for the entire record is δ2H=0.74 ‰ and δ18O=0.21 ‰. Uncertainties vary through the data set and were exacerbated by a range of factors, which typically could not be isolated due to the requirements of the multi-instrument CFA campaign. These factors likely occurred in combination and included ice quality, ice breaks, upstream equipment failure, contamination with drill fluid and leaks or valve degradation. We demonstrate that our methodology for documenting uncertainty was effective across periods of uneven system performance and delivered a significant achievement in the precision of high-resolution CFA water isotope measurements.",13/08/2018,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 6:33,4725-4736,,8,11,,Atmos.

Nasal colonization triggers IgG responses against staphylococcal surface antigens; however, these antibodies cannot prevent subsequent colonization or disease. Here, we describe               S. aureus               WU1, a multilocus sequence type 88 (ST88) isolate that persistently colonizes the nasopharynx in mice. We report that staphylococcal protein A (SpA) is required for persistence of               S. aureus               WU1 in the nasopharynx. Compared to animals colonized by wild-type               S. aureus               , mice colonized with the Δ               spa               variant mount increased IgG responses against staphylococcal colonization determinants. Immunization of mice with a nontoxigenic SpA variant, which cannot cross-link B cell receptors and divert antibody responses, elicits protein A-neutralizing antibodies that promote IgG responses against colonizing               S. aureus               and diminish pathogen persistence.                                         IMPORTANCE               Staphylococcus aureus               persistently colonizes the nasopharynx in about one-third of the human population, thereby promoting community- and hospital-acquired infections. Antibiotics are currently used for decolonization of individuals at increased risk of infection. However, the efficacy of antibiotics is limited by recolonization and selection for drug-resistant strains. Here, we propose a model of how staphylococcal protein A (SpA), a B cell superantigen, modifies host immune responses during colonization to support continued persistence of               S. aureus               in the nasopharynx. We show that this mechanism can be thwarted by vaccine-induced anti-SpA antibodies that promote IgG responses against staphylococcal antigens and diminish colonization.",2018-05,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 6:33,,,9,200,,J Bacteriol,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\AC2UIX6V\Sun et al. - 2018 - Staphylococcal Protein A Contributes to Persistent.pdf,,,,"DiRita, Victor J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Broad-scale pest management to combat such effects benefits from forecasting of irruptions and an assessment of the optimal control conditions for minimising consumer abundance. We use a climate-based consumer-resource model to predict irruptions of a pest species (               Mus musculus               ) population in response to masting (episodic synchronous seed production) and extend this model to account for broad-scale pest control of mice using toxic bait. The extended model is used to forecast the magnitude and frequency of pest irruptions under low, moderate and high control levels, and for different timings of control operations. In particular, we assess the optimal control timing required to minimise the frequency with which pests reach ‘plague’ levels, whilst avoiding excessive toxin use. Model predictions suggest the optimal timing for mouse control in beech forest, with respect to minimising plague time, is mid-September. Of the control regimes considered, a seedfall driven biannual-biennial regime gave the greatest reduction in plague time and plague years for low and moderate control levels. Although inspired by a model validated using house mouse populations in New Zealand forests, our modelling approach is easily adapted for application to other climate-driven systems where broad-scale control is conducted on irrupting pest populations.",20/12/2018,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 6:33,e6146,,,6,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\B5LXJEM7\Holland et al. - 2018 - Optimal control of irrupting pest populations in a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, conventional distribution maps rapidly become out of date and fail to provide useful information for wildlife managers. For invasive brushtail possum populations in New Zealand, the main causes of change are control programs by central and local government agencies, and post-control recovery through recolonisation and in situ recruitment. Managers need to know current, and likely future, possum population levels relative to control targets to help assess success at preventing the spread of disease or for protecting indigenous species. Information on the outcomes of government-funded possum control needs to be readily available to members of the general public interested in issues such as conservation, disease management and animal welfare. Aims To produce dynamic, scalable maps of the current and predicted future distribution and abundance of possums in New Zealand, taking into account changes due to control, and to use recent visualisation technology to make this information accessible to managers and the general public for assessing control strategies at multiple spatial scales. Methods We updated an existing individual-based spatial model of possum population dynamics, extending it to represent all individuals in a national population of up to 40 million. In addition, we created a prototype interface for interactive web-based presentation of the model’s predictions. Key results The improved capability of the new model for assessing possum management at local-to-national scales provided for real-time, mapped updates and forecasts of the distribution and abundance of possums in New Zealand. The versatility of this platform was illustrated using scenarios for current and emerging issues in New Zealand. These are hypothetical incursions of possums, reinvasion of large areas cleared of possums, and impacts on animal welfare of national-scale management of possums as vectors of bovine tuberculosis (TB). Conclusions The new individual-based spatial model for possum populations in New Zealand demonstrated the utility of combining models of wildlife population dynamics with high-speed computing capability to provide up-to-date, easily accessible information on a species’ distribution and abundance. Applications include predictions for future changes in response to incursions, reinvasion and large-scale possum control. Similar models can be used for other species for which there are suitable demographic data, typically pest species, harvested species or species with a high conservation value. Implications Models such as the spatial model for possums in New Zealand can provide platforms for (1) real-time visualisation of wildlife distribution and abundance, (2) reporting and assessing progress towards achieving management goals at multiple scales, (3) use as a decision-support tool to scope potential changes in wildlife populations or simulate the outcomes of alternative management strategies, and (4) making information about pest control publicly available.",2018,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 6:33,336,,4,45,,Wildl.

To investigate the introduction and dispersal of dogs across the country we generated twenty-three new complete, or nearly complete, mitogenomes from ancient DNA from dog teeth sampled from four early archaeological sites in New Zealand and from one archaeological site in the southern Cook Islands. When considered together with fourteen previously reported mitogenomes from the New Zealand colonisation era site of Wairau Bar these sequences reveal a striking lack of mitochondrial genetic diversity in early New Zealand dogs. Our analysis shows that a group of closely-related dogs were brought to New Zealand, probably from an East Polynesian source population, and that these dogs and their offspring were widely dispersed throughout the country during the colonisation process. This pattern is consistent with the current model of rapid colonisation of New Zealand undertaken by highly mobile groups of people.",1/01/2018,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,1-Oct,,,9,,Journal of Pacific Archaeology,,,,,,,,,,,,,ResearchGate,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\P7LBDSYH\Greig et al. - 2018 - Ancient DNA Evidence for the Introduction and Disp.pdf; ,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323644195_Ancient_DNA_Evidence_for_the_Introduction_and_Dispersal_of_Dogs_Canis_familiaris_in_New_Zealand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Central to this initiative is incorporating the effects of the inherent variation that lies within genomes and can influence health outcomes. Identifying and interpreting such variation requires an accurate, valid and representative dataset to firstly define what variants are present and then assess the potential relevance for the health of a person, their family/whānau and the wider community to which they belong. Globally the variation embedded within genomes differs enormously and has been shaped by the size, constitution, historical origins and evolutionary history of their source populations. Māori, and more broadly Pacific peoples, differ substantially in terms of genomic variation compared to the more closely studied European and Asian populations. In the absence of accurate genomic information from Māori and Pacific populations, the precise interpretation of genomic data and the success and benefits of genomic medicine will be disproportionately less for those Māori and Pacific peoples. In this viewpoint article we, as a group of healthcare professionals, researchers and scientists, present a case for assembling genomic resources that catalogue the characteristics of the genomes of New Zealanders, with an emphasis on peoples of Māori and Polynesian ancestry, as a healthcare imperative. In proposing the creation of these resources, we note that their governance and management must be led by iwi and Māori and Pacific representatives. Assembling a genomic resource must be informed by cultural concepts and values most especially understanding that, at a physical and spiritual level, whakapapa is embodied within the DNA of a person. Therefore DNA and genomic data that connects to whakapapa (genealogy) is considered a taonga (something precious and significant), and its storage, utilisation and interpretation is a culturally significant activity. Furthermore, such resources are not proposed to primarily enable comparisons between those with Māori and broader Pacific ancestries and other Aotearoa peoples but to place an understanding of the genetic contributors to their health outcomes in a valid context. Ongoing oversight and governance of such taonga by Māori and Pacific representatives will maximise hauora (health) while also minimising the risk of misuse of this information.",17/08/2018,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,81-89,,1480,131,,N Z Med J,"Genomic medicine must reduce, not compound, health inequities",,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 30116069,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30116069,,"Genomics; Humans; New Zealand; Genetics, Medical; Healthcare Disparities; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; Precision Medicine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM: To use robust statistical methods to assess whether there is evidence of any true effect of class size on fault prediction models. METHOD: We examine the potential mediation and moderation effects of class size on the relationships between OO metrics and number of faults. We employ regression analysis and bootstrapping- based methods to investigate the mediation and moderation effects in two widely-used datasets comprising seventeen systems. RESULTS: We find no strong evidence of a significant mediation or moderation effect of class size on the relationships between OO metrics and faults. In particular, size appears to have a more significant mediation effect on CBO and Fan-out than other metrics, although the evidence is not consistent in all examined systems. On the other hand, size does appear to have a significant moderation effect on WMC and CBO in most of the systems examined. Again, the evidence provided is not consistent across all examined systems CONCLUSION: We are unable to confirm if class size has a significant mediation or moderation effect on the relationships between OO metrics and the number of faults. We contend that class size does not fully explain the relationships between OO metrics and the number of faults, and it does not always affect the strength/magnitude of these relationships. We recommend that researchers consider the potential mediation and moderation effect of class size when building their prediction models, but this should be examined independently for each system.",11/10/2018,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 7:21,1-Oct,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,Oulu Finland,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\K4XIU8AG\Tahir et al. - 2018 - Revisiting the size effect in software fault predi.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ESEM '18: ACM / IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In some problems, however, samples are expensive to obtain. This motivates consideration of sample-efficient optimization. A successful approach has been to choose new points to evaluate by considering a distribution over plausible surfaces conditioned on all previous points and their evaluations. To do this the distribution must be updated as each new evaluation is acquired, which has motivated the development of Bayesian methods that update a prior to a posterior over functions. By far, the most common prior distribution in use for this application is the Gaussian process. Here, we consider another family of priors, namely Bayesian Neural Networks. We argue that these exhibit strengths that are different or complementary to Gaussian processes and show that they are competitive or superior on a wide range of test optimization problems.",2018-11,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,1-Nov,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,ISSN: 2151-2205,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\ZPJ7AFBD\8634788.html,,,Computational modeling; Standards; Bayes methods; Bayesian; Efficient; Gaussian processes; Linear programming; Neural Network; Neural networks; Optimization; Surrogate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018 International Conference on Image and Vision Computing New Zealand (IVCNZ),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Algal growth in the lake has historically been N limited, but has become P limited through a programme of alum dosing that has successfully controlled cyanobacterial and algal blooms since 2010. This presentation reviews and synthesizes science developed on the nitrogen budgets and dynamics within the catchment and the lake as part of a 5-yearly science review process. The main source of N inputs to the catchment occurs via clover N fixation in pastoral agriculture, which is estimated to be greater than N fertiliser application. Substantial reduction in the N load to the lake, and associated impacts, was achieved in 1991 through urban wastewater treatment, but was later negated through increases in agricultural intensity and associated N losses to the lake via streams. By 2005, land use and other sources of new inputs to the lake were capped at 2001 levels. Legislation has proposed to reduce the N load entering the lake to 435 Mg y-1 by 2032, which is a substantial reduction from from the 755 Mg y-1 estimated as a steady-state post-2001 load. Application of the lake hydrodynamics-ecosystem model DYRESM-CAEDYM successfully predicts outcomes of different N and P nutrient loading to support policy. Review of monitoring data associated with key areas of model testing and improvement has revealed useful lessons. First, changing internal N dynamics within the lake following the initiation of the alum dosing programme and associated P limitation reversed a trend of decreasing N retention that coincided with increasing eutrophication. Second, improving temporal and spatial detail for N loads to the lake in major streams was the most important factor to improve model performance. A separate trend evaluation found unexpected flat and decreasing inflow nitrate concentrations in catchments with long tritium-derived mean residence times. As a result, future benefits appear likely from understanding in-lake N dynamics, rapid responses of catchments with old groundwater, and extending monitoring to better detect the effects of management changes in subcatchments.",1/12/2018,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 7:06,B12A-05,,,2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2018AGUFM.B12A..05B,,,,,3322 Land/atmosphere interactions; and modeling; ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSESDE: 0469 Nitrogen cycling; BIOGEOSCIENCESDE: 0478 Pollution: urban; BIOGEOSCIENCESDE: 1615 Biogeochemical cycles; GLOBAL CHANGE; processes; regional and global,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting, Washington D.C.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What mechanism(s) could drive these differences and how these mechanisms would impact blood transport has not been widely investigated. We used a Monte-Carlo simulation to mimic three mechanisms for controlling vascular growth: vessels grow faster and longer, terminate more frequently before branching, and flow directions are more tightly controlled in the at-risk simulations. For each mechanism, we analyzed simulated vascular networks based on structural properties and blood flow, assuming Poiseuille’s law and distensible vessels. Our simulations showed that none of these mechanisms alone could reproduce all structural properties of vascular networks in placentas identified as at-risk for autism. Terminating vessels more frequently or growing longer vessels could each reproduce longer vessels and less branching, but not greater boundary coverage or smaller changes in flow directions. As for their influence on blood flow, longer vessels and less branching have large, opposing effects on network function. Networks with longer vessels are less efficient in terms of slower flow rates and higher total network volume; in contrast, networks with less branching are more efficient. Our results suggest either these mechanisms work together to drive observed differences in vascular networks of at-risk individuals by balancing their impacts on network function; or another mechanism not considered here might drive these differences.",2018,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 7:04,145-169,,,,,,,Association for Women in Mathematics Series,,,,Springer International Publishing,Cham,en,,,,,Springer Link,,DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-98083-6_7,,,,,Autism; Blood flow; Placentas; Simulations; Vascular networks,"Radunskaya, Ami; Segal, Rebecca; Shtylla, Blerta",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this graph-theoretic measure was underused for decades because of the inherent complexity in its computation which is closely related to solving NP-hard graph optimisation problems like MAXCUT. We develop new quadratic and linear programming models to compute the line index of balance exactly. Using the Gurobi integer programming optimisation solver, we evaluate the line index of balance on real-world and synthetic datasets. The synthetic data involves Erdős-Rényi graphs, Barabási-Albert graphs, and specially structured random graphs. We also use well-known datasets from the sociology literature, such as signed graphs inferred from students’ choice and rejection, as well as datasets from the biology literature including gene regulatory networks. The results show that exact values of the line index of balance in relatively large signed graphs can be efficiently computed using our suggested optimisation models. We find that most real-world social networks and some biological networks have a small line index of balance which indicates that they are close to balanced.",2018,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 6:55,65-84,,,,,,,Springer Optimization and Its Applications,,,,Springer International Publishing,Cham,en,,,,,Springer Link,,DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-94830-0_3,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\Y9IFIMRF\Aref et al. - 2018 - Computing the Line Index of Balance Using Integer .pdf,,,,"Goldengorin, Boris",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3M43SQ5Y,report,2017,"Alimi, Omoniyi B; Poot, Jacques; Maré, David C.","More pensioners, less income inequality?",,,,,,"As is the case in most developed countries, the population of New Zealand is ageing numerically and structurally. Population ageing can have important effects on the distribution of personal income within and between urban areas. The age structure of the population may affect the distribution of income through the life-cycle profile of earnings but also through the spatialtemporal distribution of income within the various age groups. By decomposing New Zealand census data from 1986 to 2013 by age and urban area, this chapter examines the effects of population ageing on spatial-temporal changes in the distribution of personal income to better understand urban area-level income inequality (measured by the Mean Log Deviation index). We focus explicitly on differences between metropolitan and non-metropolitan urban areas. New Zealand has experienced a significant increase in income inequality over the last few decades, but population ageing has slightly dampened this trend. Because metropolitan areas are ageing slower, the inequality-reducing effect of ageing has been less in these areas. However, this urban-size differential-ageing effect on inequality growth has been relatively small compared with the faster growth in intra-age group inequality in the metropolitan areas.",2017,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,"C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\LXXSYYRM\Roberts - More pensioners, less income inequality.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ZV4WTNKL,report,2017,"Salmon, Rhian A; Leining, Catherine",New Zealand's Climate Change Engagement Landscape - Results of a Survey by the  Deep South Challenge Engagement Programme,,,,,https://zenodo.org/record/839945,"The Deep South Challenge (DSC) includes a significant Engagement Programme with the goal of helping New Zealanders to make decisions informed by climate science, and to inform DSC research. Designing an effective engagement strategy for the DSC requires a broad understanding of the current climate change engagement landscape in New Zealand and the identification of opportunities for partnership and collaboration. From 23 October to 6 November 2015, the Engagement Programme collected information about current climate change engagement activity in New Zealand by distributing a voluntary survey to 372 people spanning 289 organisations representing government, research, business, NGO, education, culture and media. Recipients were encouraged to circulate the invitation further as appropriate. Responses were received from 125 people, some in their individual capacity rather than as organisational representatives. Of these, 111 had substantive content, and 50 allowed at least some level of public reporting of the information provided. Survey questions addressed who is conducting current or planned climate change engagement activity, what audiences they are targeting, what activities and mechanisms they are using, what gaps they perceive in engagement activity and in the availability of information about climate change science, what priorities they would suggest for DSC research, and whether they would be interested in collaborating or partnering on DSC engagement. The survey also invited more detailed information about respondents’ specific engagement activities. The survey achieved a broad and diverse, but not deep, sampling of sectoral interests with regard to climate change engagement. The most notable gaps in coverage by respondents include media, Māori/iwi and foundations/philanthropic organisations. Given the relatively small sample size and uneven coverage of the survey, the survey results should be treated as an informative indication and not a comprehensive or representative accounting of change engagement activity in New Zealand. The survey found that a broad and diverse array of organisations and individuals serving different constituencies are currently conducting climate change engagement activities in New Zealand and overseas. They are using a range of engagement methods and tools. Climate change engagement activities more commonly address multiple aspects of climate change (e.g. physical science basis; impacts, adaptation and vulnerability; and mitigation) rather than a single aspect. Climate change information needs more commonly identified by respondents included: Regional-scale and sectoral analysis of climate change impacts and implications in New Zealand over different time horizons, with a “roadmap” for future research delivery Climate change impacts on sea level rise, marine systems, coastal zones, weather systems, the water cycle and the agriculture sector Integration of the science of climate change with the science of behaviour change. Respondents recommended ways to make climate change engagement more effective by: Making climate change information more accessible to the public Increasing public receptiveness to climate change information Improving public understanding of climate change information Facilitating practical action on mitigation and adaptation. Climate change engagement initiatives profiled by respondents included a range of activities: research and data collection; information sharing; education and experiential learning; training and certification; advocacy and community organising; public dialogue and consensus; and action on mitigation or adaptation. Many survey respondents expressed interest in working with the DSC in some capacity or suggested other potential collaborators for the DSC. These survey results could serve as a baseline for tracking changes in climate change engagement activity over time. Future iterations of this survey could attempt to fill gaps in coverage of sectoral interests and assess the impacts of engagement initiatives supported by the DSC Engagement Programme. Complementary research could focus on the target audiences for climate change engagement activities to assess the breadth of their exposure to climate change engagement activity, the depth of their involvement, the effectiveness and perceived credibility of different channels for obtaining information, and their level of understanding and practical application of climate change information. This report documents the subset of survey findings for which public disclosure was permitted by the respondents. With only minor exceptions, the general trends discussed in this report reflect those associated with the full data set. Neither the partial nor the full data set constitutes a representative sampling of nationwide climate change engagement activity, and all of the findings are indicative rather than conclusive. In that context, those minor exceptions are not material to the use of this report to help inform the design of future climate change engagement activity in New Zealand.",8/08/2017,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 5:14,,,,,,,,,,,,Zenodo,,,,,,,Zenodo,,DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.839945,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\GBW5X3YI\Salmon and Leining - 2017 - New Zealand's Climate Change Engagement Landscape .pdf,,,"climate change communication, Aotearoa New Zealand, public engagement with science",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Examining the roles of sorting, productivity differences, and discrimination.",,,,,,"As in other OECD countries, women in New Zealand earn substantially less than men with similar observable characteristics. In this paper, we use a decade of annual wage and productivity data from New Zealand’s Linked Employer-Employee Database to examine different explanations for this gender wage gap. Sorting by gender at either the industry or firm level explains less than one-fifth of the overall wage gap. Gender differences in productivity within firms also explain little of the difference seen in wages. The relationships between the gender wage-productivity gap and both age and tenure are inconsistent with statistical discrimination being an important explanatory factor for the remaining differences in wages. Relating across industry and over time variation in the gender wage-productivity gap to industry-year variation in worker skills, and product market and labour market competition, we find evidence that is consistent with taste discrimination being important for explaining the overall gender wage gap. Explanations based on gender differences in bargaining power are less consistent with our findings.",2017,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,Motu Working Paper,,,Zotero,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\VICIB22V\Roberts - What drives the gender wage gap Examining the rol.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This complicates the concept learning process and may lead to the rejection of some simple and expressive rules that cover many cases. In this paper we present an approach to this problem in description logic learning by computing partial descriptions (which are not necessarily entirely complete) of both positive and negative examples and combining them. Our Symmetric Parallel Class Expression Learning approach enables the generation of general rules with exception patterns included. We demonstrate that this algorithm provides significantly better results (in terms of metrics such as accuracy, search space covered, and learning time) than standard approaches on some typical data sets. Further, the approach has the added benefit that it can be parallelised relatively simply, leading to much faster exploration of the search tree on modern computers.",2017,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 3:57,Jan-34,,64,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,www.jmlr.org,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\XQIEU8AE\Tran et al. - 2017 - Parallel Symmetric Class Expression Learning.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gland is of current interest because it provides a source for volatile chemicals that can be used by birds in communication. We examined the anatomy of uropygial glands in Apteryx for the first time. The gland was located immediately caudal to the cloaca and surrounding the coccygeal bone rather than rostral to the coccygeal bone and above the posterior free caudal vertebrae as in other birds. This may explain why it has not been recognised until relatively recently. Like most uropygial glands Apteryx's were bilobar but possessed eight primary sinuses, each opening through its own orifice in the gland's papilla. Primary ducts were compact and branches of connective tissue extending from the capsule internally formed interfollicular septae that were thicker in some areas, grouping follicles into discrete lobules. Striated muscle was present in the capsule, a characteristic so far unique to Apteryx that may be used in controlling the expulsion of secretion. There were significant differences in the architecture of the follicles between species and sexes that suggest differences in the production, storage and availability of uropygial gland secretion. This was supported by variations in live bird's gland volume between two years of sampling. Atrophy of the uropygial gland was seen in two birds in poor condition suggesting that health impacts the functioning of the gland. This finding suggests an adaptive significance for the gland and offers a possible way for birds to communicate their health status through the production or composition of the secretion. More research is needed to fully understand the relationship between the anatomy of the gland in Apteryx and its function, but we propose that it plays roles in both feather maintenance and sociality.",1/01/2017,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,125-139,,,21,,European Journal of Anatomy,Apteryx spp. (Kiwi) possess an uropygial gland,,,,,,,,,,,,ResearchGate,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Isabel-Castro-10/publication/317028873_Apteryx_spp_Kiwi_possess_an_uropygial_gland_Anatomy_and_pathology/links/593e776f45851506cb7b80cd/Apteryx-spp-Kiwi-possess-an-uropygial-gland-Anatomy-and-pathology.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous methods of detecting LGT events all rely on two fundamental strategies: primary structure composition or gene tree/species tree comparisons. Discouragingly, the results of these different approaches rarely coincide. With the wealth of genome data now available, detection of laterally transferred genes is increasingly being attempted in large uncurated eukaryotic datasets. However, detection methods depend greatly on the quality of the underlying genomic data, which are typically complex for eukaryotes. Furthermore, given the automated nature of genomic data collection, it is typically impractical to manually verify all protein or gene models, orthology predictions, and multiple sequence alignments, requiring researchers to accept a substantial margin of error in their datasets. Using a test case comprising plant-associated genomes across the fungal kingdom, this study reveals that composition- and phylogeny-based methods have little statistical power to detect laterally transferred genes. In particular, phylogenetic methods reveal extreme levels of topological variation in fungal gene trees, the vast majority of which show departures from the canonical species tree. Therefore, it is inherently challenging to detect LGT events in typical eukaryotic genomes. This finding is in striking contrast to the large number of claims for laterally transferred genes in eukaryotic species that routinely appear in the literature, and questions how many of these proposed examples are statistically well supported.",1/04/2017,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 2:17,1301-1314,,4,7,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\IAXRZALG\Dupont and Cox - 2017 - Genomic Data Quality Impacts Automated Detection o.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By comparing phylogenies of genes and languages, we identify one source of this association. In traditional tribal societies, marriage customs channel language transmission. When women remain in their natal community and men disperse (matrilocality), children learn their mothers’ language, and language correlates with maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA. For the converse kinship practice (patrilocality), language instead correlates with paternally inherited Y chromosome. Kinship rules dictating postmarital residence can persist for many generations and determine population genetic structure at the community scale. The long-term association of languages with genetic clades created by kinship systems provides information about language transmission, and about the structure and persistence of social groups.           ,              Languages are transmitted through channels created by kinship systems. Given sufficient time, these kinship channels can change the genetic and linguistic structure of populations. In traditional societies of eastern Indonesia, finely resolved cophylogenies of languages and genes reveal persistent movements between stable speech communities facilitated by kinship rules. When multiple languages are present in a region and postmarital residence rules encourage sustained directional movement between speech communities, then languages should be channeled along uniparental lines. We find strong evidence for this pattern in 982 individuals from 25 villages on two adjacent islands, where different kinship rules have been followed. Core groups of close relatives have stayed together for generations, while remaining in contact with, and marrying into, surrounding groups. Over time, these kinship systems shaped their gene and language phylogenies: Consistently following a postmarital residence rule turned social communities into speech communities.",5/12/2017,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 2:17,12910-12915,,49,114,,Proc.

The intervention, which targeted adults aged 25-44 years who were overweight or obese, employed both an empowerment-based programme and a co-design approach to motivate community members to participate in a physical-activity-based intervention programme. RESULTS: Findings show significant reductions in total body weight and waist circumference, as well as improved physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: The strength of this intervention was evident in the innovative approach of utilising Pasifika-youth-led and co-designed approaches to motivate communities into healthier lifestyles.

This enables a comparison of cloud representation in models and observations. The simulation of stratocumulus clouds over the Southern Ocean is shown to have changed substantially from earlier generation models. The CMIP6 models analyzed show stratocumulus clouds now occur more often in simulations than in International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) observations, but are not bright enough compared to Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) data. This is in contrast to the “too few, too bright” problem, which has characterized prior model simulations of stratocumulus clouds, particularly over the Southern Ocean. The cloud clusters also enable the calculation of mean and compensating shortwave cloud radiative effect (SW CRE) errors from model data. The compensating errors are shown to be much larger than mean errors suggesting the CMIP6 models still have much to improve in their cloud representation. A statistically significant negative relationship between the mean and compensating errors in SW CRE over the Southern Ocean is identified. This relationship is observed elsewhere, but is only significant over the Southern Ocean. This implies model tuning efforts are hiding biases in the representation of clouds in this region. CMIP6 models have been shown to have a higher equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) relative to CMIP5 simulations.

Ramp metering, by controlling access to the motorway at onramps, can help avoid this loss of throughput. The queues that form at onramps are dependent on the metering rates chosen at the onramps, and these choices affect how the capacities of different motorway sections are shared amongst competing flows. In this paper we perform an analytical study of a fluid, or differential equation, model of a linear network topology with onramp queues. The model allows for adaptive arrivals, in the sense that the rate at which external traffic enters the queue at an onramp can depend on the current perceived delay in that queue. The model also includes a ramp metering policy which uses global onramp queue length information to determine the rate at which traffic enters the motorway from each onramp. This ramp metering policy minimizes the maximum delay over all onramps and produces equal delay times over many onramps. The paper characterizes both the dynamics and the equilibrium behavior of the system under this policy. While we consider an idealized model that leaves out many practical details, an aim of the paper is to develop analytical methods that yield interesting qualitative insights and might be adapted to more general contexts. The paper can be considered as a step in developing an analytical approach towards studying more complex network topologies and incorporating other model features.",1/12/2021,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,17/06/2022 6:34,175-214,,1,84,,Appl Math Optim,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\Y3ZUPFHY\Helton et al. - 2021 - A Fluid Model of a Traffic Network with Informatio.pdf,,,37N35; 90B10; 90B20; 93B52; Adaptive arrivals; Dynamic traffic network model; Equilibrium states; Feedback signals; Global delay minimization; Long run behavior; Ramp metering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is an extension of the work reported earlier, which uses historical energy consumption data of the University of Auckland buildings and historical outdoor temperatures for the Auckland region in New Zealand. The current work uses statistics to obtain average base temperatures for the building and the minimum electricity price threshold. Two scenarios are simulated in Matlab Simulink, the first being the heating system price responsive behaviour and the second for heating system in operation with the 30 minute locational marginal trading price as an input variable.

The timing of these dynamics is crucial for sensation, perception, cognition, and ultimately consciousness, but the underlying dynamics governing the constant reorganization and switching between networks are not yet well understood. Electroencephalogram (EEG) microstates are brief periods of stable scalp topography that have been identified as the electrophysiological correlate of functional magnetic resonance imaging defined resting-state networks. Spatiotemporal microstate sequences maintain high temporal resolution and have been shown to be scale-free with long-range temporal correlations. Previous attempts to model EEG microstate sequences have failed to capture this crucial property and so cannot fully capture the dynamics; this paper answers the call for more sophisticated modeling approaches. We present a dynamical model that exhibits a noisy network attractor between nodes that represent the microstates. Using an excitable network between four nodes, we can reproduce the transition probabilities between microstates but not the heavy tailed residence time distributions. We present two extensions to this model: first, an additional hidden node at each state; second, an additional layer that controls the switching frequency in the original network. Introducing either extension to the network gives the flexibility to capture these heavy tails. We compare the model generated sequences to microstate sequences from EEG data collected from healthy subjects at rest. For the first extension, we show that the hidden nodes ‘trap’ the trajectories allowing the control of residence times at each node. For the second extension, we show that two nodes in the controlling layer are sufficient to model the long residence times. Finally, we show that in addition to capturing the residence time distributions and transition probabilities of the sequences, these two models capture additional properties of the sequences including having interspersed long and short residence times and long range temporal correlations in line with the data as measured by the Hurst exponent.",4/01/2021,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,17/06/2022 1:05,1,,1,11,,The Journal of Mathematical Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,BioMed Central,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\H8LDWTWF\Creaser et al. - 2021 - Noisy network attractor models for transitions bet.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\99BH9A22\s13408-020-00100-0.html,,,EEG microstates; Excitable network model; Long range temporal correlations; Noisy network attractor; Residence times; Transition process,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed approach has been undertaken in pursuit of creating a software tool that can predict the impact of increased renewable distributed sources on load profiles. Several concerns and challenges arise as a result of this increase, as large transients are formed in these profiles causing a potential over-generation problem. As the number of smart meters and advanced metering infrastructure also increases, the demand for big data analytics systems becomes increasingly urgent. Pairing an intelligent hybrid neural network solution with an online cloud software makes the management of big data, in the form of smart meter load consumption data, more efficient and effective. The process of the proposed solution is that it first decomposes this data into components that represent more detailed periodic information within the time series. These components are then input into several extreme learning machine algorithms and the outputs are then recombined to make a load forecast and prediction of future load consumption data. The learning behaviour is vital and helps tuning with each new iteration increasing accuracy. A comparison of this paper's approach is benchmarked against the popular Levenberg- Marquardt training algorithm. The results obtained indicate the superiority of the wavelet-extreme learning machine hybrid compared to industry standard statistical methods and other hybrid neural network techniques.",2021-04,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,1-Aug,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\LYLZ3L82\9435262.html,,,Training; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; big data; Big Data; extreme learning machine; Extreme learning machines; forecasting; Load forecasting; prediction; Prediction algorithms; smart meter; Statistical analysis; time series; Time series analysis; wavelet transform,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021 IEEE Power and Energy Conference at Illinois (PECI),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, due to the computational complexity of the models’ attention mechanisms, the input length they can work with is currently limited. Inspired by the human tendency to ignore many words during a reading comprehension task, we experiment with the effect of removing tokens from a sequence for sentiment analysis. In this preliminary study, we analyze a length-reducing system based on layer-level attention scores. The expectation is that this allows us to discover what percentage of input length is required to obtain a reasonable amount of accuracy in a sentiment analysis task. We show that the ﬁltering system based on BERT allows us to reduce sequences lengths of up to 99% in a sentiment analysis task while still obtaining 70% accuracy.",2021,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\36ZECNZV\Tan et al. - An explainability analysis of a sentiment predicti.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Advances in Cognitive Systems 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Addressing failures at such sites can be very expensive, both in identifying the fault, and also in the repair or rectification. Data monitoring can be useful, to spot anomalies and predict a fault (and possibly pre-empt it altogether), or to locate and isolate it quickly once it causes an issue for the network. There might be hundreds of variables to be monitored in principle, but only a few of significance for detecting faults. Here, in a case study involving a Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP) in a rural area, we first illustrate a bottom-up approach to the identification of variables likely to be of use in an automatic anomaly detector. For the purpose of this study, the detector consists of an autoencoder neural network with weights optimized by machine learning (ML). We then show how the cause of an anomaly can be derived from indirect measurements, and use the model to learn relationships between certain variables.",2021-01,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,421-428,,,,,,Humans Learning from Machines,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,ISSN: 2155-2509,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\FKZF3MUA\9352890.html,,,Wireless communication; Neural networks; Anomaly Detection; Batteries; Detectors; Fault diagnosis; Feature Identification; Machine Learning; Monitoring; Web and internet services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021 International Conference on COMmunication Systems & NETworkS (COMSNETS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We first look at studies that conceptualise political ideology along a unidimensional liberal-conservative spectrum and explore whether there are behavioural differences between liberals and conservatives. While recent studies find that liberals display more pro-sociality, many other studies find that liberals and conservatives display similar levels of pro-social, ingroup-biased, normative, and punitive behaviour. We then turn to experiments that study two-dimensional political ideology as embodied in the concepts of economic conservatism/progressivism (often measured with the Social Dominance Orientation scale) and social conservatism/progressivism (usually measured with the Right-Wing Authoritarianism scale). In such experiments, economic conservatives display lower levels of pro-sociality and universalism and greater tolerance of inequality and tendencies to harm outgroups. Social conservatives tend to display “groupishness”, including distrusting anonymous strangers, cooperating with ingroup members, following rules, punishing in the ultimatum game, and sometimes harming outgroups.",6/07/2021,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,21/06/2022 3:00,,,,,,,,,,,,Edward Elgar Publishing,,en_US,,,,,www.elgaronline.com,,Publication Title: A Research Agenda for Experimental Economics,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\9DILMCQN\9781789909845.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The measures are constructed for 31 urban areas in New Zealand using five-yearly census data covering 1986–2013. We adopt a gravity model of regional migration—augmented by destination and origin QL and QB—to model bilateral flows of working-age migrants (post-tertiary education and pre-retirement age). We also model flows between urban and rural areas and flows for the urban areas to and from overseas locations. We find different attractors for international versus domestic migrants according to the type of city amenity. International migrants are more attracted to cities with productive amenities, whereas domestic migrants are more attracted to places with consumption amenities. Thus, in deciding on the type of city amenity to enhance, city officials implicitly choose the type of migrant they attract as well as the type of city that may result.",2021,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,21/06/2022 2:23,97-121,,,,,,,New Frontiers in Regional Science: Asian Perspectives,,,,Springer,Singapore,en,,,,,Springer Link,,DOI: 10.1007/978-981-15-9275-1_5,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\2P2TREW6\Grimes et al. - 2021 - The Contrasting Importance of Quality of Life and .pdf,,,Amenities; Gravity model; Migration; Quality of business; Quality of life,"Cochrane, William; Cameron, Michael P.; Alimi, Omoniyi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By tracking workers as they move across jobs in different types of firms, we document the extent of the “foreign wage premium” distinguishing between compositional factors (e.g., differences in industry and employment composition between foreign and domestic firms) and remaining differences in wage levels and growth rates. We find that much of the average earnings gap between foreign- and domestically-owned firms is due to compositional factors—foreign firms tend to be larger and to employ workers who would have received relatively high wages regardless of where they worked. However, even among apparently similar workers and firms, we find a two to four percent earnings gap between workers in domestic and foreign-owned firms. This gap is primarily associated with a wage increase of around two percent on moving from a domestic to a foreign firm, augmented by higher wage growth within foreign-owned firms. However, these premia appear to be specific to foreign-firm employment, as workers who return to domestically-owned firms do not appear to retain these additional earnings in their subsequent jobs.",2021,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,21/06/2022 2:24,Jan-40,,,,,,,New Frontiers in Regional Science: Asian Perspectives,,,,Springer,Singapore,en,,,,,Springer Link,,DOI: 10.1007/978-981-15-9275-1_1,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\4IG5E9ZJ\Maré et al. - 2021 - Earnings and Employment in Foreign-Owned Firms.pdf,,,,"Cochrane, William; Cameron, Michael P.; Alimi, Omoniyi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As of 20 October, testing in MIQ had identified 215 cases of SARS-CoV-2 from a total of 62,698 arrivals. While the majority of infections were likely obtained in the country of origin prior to departure, there have been possible reports of in-flight transmission. Methods: Seven people who arrived in New Zealand on the same flight on 29 September tested positive during their stay in MIQ (out of 86 passengers). The seven passengers originated from five different countries before travelling on the same flight from Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) to Auckland, New Zealand. Information about their journeys, disease progression and virus genomic data was used to assess possible points of infection. Findings: All seven SARS-CoV-2 genomes were genetically identical, with the exception of a single mutation in one case, and all genomes had five signature mutations seen in only six other genomes from the >155,000 genomes sequenced globally. Four of these six related genome sequences were from Switzerland, the country of origin of the suspected index case.

Climate change and the expected increase in intensity and frequency of extreme weather-related events are likely to translate into higher damages and thus an additional financial liability for the EQC. We project future insured damages from extreme precipitation events associated with future projected climatic change. We first estimate the empirical relationship between extreme precipitation events and the EQC’s weather-related insurance claims based on a complete dataset of all claims from 2000 to 2017. We then use this estimated relationship, together with climate projections based on future greenhouse gases concentration scenarios from six different dynamically downscaled Regional Climate Models, to predict the impact of future extreme precipitation events on EQC liabilities for different time horizons up to the year 2100. Our results show predicted adverse impacts that vary -increase or decrease over time and space. The percent change between projected and past damages—the climate change signal—ranges between an increase of 7% and 8% higher in the period 2020 to 2040, and between 9% and 25% higher in the period 2080 to 2100. We also provide detail caveats as to why these quantities might be mis-estimated. The projected increase in the public insurer’s liabilities could also be used to inform private insurers, regulators, and policymakers who are assessing the future performance of both the public and private insurers that cover weatherrelated risks in the face of climatic change.",2020,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,32,,,,,,,,,,,Motu,,en,,Working paper,,,Zotero,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\D2RQLCR2\Pastor-Paz et al. - Projecting the effect of climate change- induced i.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20-Feb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A loss of the brightest can lead to reduced business creation, innovation, growth and community wellbeing in such regions. We use rich longitudinal microdata from New Zealand’s integrated administrative data infrastructure to analyse the determinants and geography of the choice of destination of tertiary educated (university and polytechnic) graduates. We address the question of post-student location choice in the context of the approach of Chen and Rosenthal (2008) who introduced a methodology for calculating ‘quality of life’ and ‘quality of business’ indicators for urban areas reflecting consumption and productive amenities respectively. Specifically, we test whether students – of different characteristics (e.g. institutional type and field of study) – locate in places that are regarded as good to live or good to do business. Our estimates are conditional on students’ prior school (home) location and the location of their higher education institution. We find that graduates are attracted to locate in places that have high quality production amenities. High quality consumption amenities have heterogeneous effects on the location choice of students. Creative Arts and Commerce graduates are relatively more likely to locate in places that are attractive to business, consistent with a symbiosis between bohemians and business.

Notwithstanding its simplicity, the model allows for adjustment frictions in housing markets; workers with heterogeneous productivities and preferences; and agglomeration economies in production and consumption. We estimate our model as a system of equations using panel data for workers residing in 132 urban settlements in New Zealand for the period 1976 to 2013. In terms of housing markets, we find strong evidence of increasing marginal costs and large adjustment frictions. The latter suggests demand shocks lead to temporarily elevated prices. In terms of agglomeration economies, we find New Zealand’s cities and towns offer economies of scale to producers, in the form of higher wages, but diseconomies of scale to consumers. By exploiting the panel structure of our data, we consider whether our findings are stable over time.

We find that average commute distance (meshblock centroid-to-centroid) fell from 2005 to 2009 before rising again through to 2018 (the final analysis year), with most regions displaying this general temporal pattern. Census 2013 place of residence and work is used to test our methodology against the alternative of using pre-existing plant allocations from the Linked Employer-Employee Data (LEED) production system. For a consistent set of individuals, our estimate of the commute distance distribution closely matches the corresponding distribution in Census. In contrast, LEED-based estimates tend to significantly overestimate commute distances, including radically overestimating the likelihood of inter-island commuting. Our more plausible results are primarily due to re-engineering the job allocation process, as opposed to exploiting better administrative data, though we make marginal improvements to residential address identification through a new prioritisation method, allowing us to use a broader set of residential address sources than available in LEED.",2020,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,78,,,,,,,,,,,Motu,,en,,Working Paper,,,Zotero,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\82PTI2KS\Fabling and Maré - Measuring commute patterns over time Using admini.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Economic Incentives, Ergonomics or Externalities",,,,,,"Research consistently finds more workplace injuries occur on Mondays than on other weekdays. One hypothesis is that workers fraudulently claim that off-the-job weekend sprains and strains occurred at work on the Monday in order to receive workers’ compensation. We test this using data from New Zealand, where compensation is virtually identical whether or not an injury occurs at work. We still find that work claims, especially sprains and strains, occur disproportionately on Mondays, although less than in other jurisdictions. This suggests fraudulent claims in other countries are just one part of the story. Furthermore, we find work claims remain high on Tuesdays, and that workers’ sprains and strains that occur off-the-job also disproportionately fall on Mondays. Sprains and strains treated at hospitals, which are not closed over the weekend, are also elevated on Mondays. However, Monday lost-time injuries are less severe than injuries on other days. Our findings are consistent with a physiological mechanism contributing to elevated Monday injury claims in New Zealand, but do not suggest doctors’ offices being closed over the weekend, ergonomic explanations, or work being riskier on Mondays play important roles.",2020,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,32,,,,,,,,,,,Motu,,en,,Working Paper,,,Zotero,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\DY6MD6HV\Poland et al. - Why are there More Accidents on Mondays Economic .pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After effectively eliminating the virus, New Zealand experienced a second outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in August 2020. During this August outbreak, New Zealand utilised genomic sequencing in a primary role to support its track and trace efforts for the first time, leading to a second successful elimination of the virus. Methods We generated the genomes of 80% of the laboratory-confirmed samples of SARS-CoV-2 from New Zealand’s August 2020 outbreak and compared these genomes to the available global genomic data. Findings Genomic sequencing was able to rapidly identify that the new COVID-19 cases in New Zealand belonged to a single cluster and hence resulted from a single introduction. However, successful identification of the origin of this outbreak was impeded by substantial biases and gaps in global sequencing data. Interpretation Access to a broader and more heterogenous sample of global genomic data would strengthen efforts to locate the source of any new outbreaks.

We examine the effect of control scenarios targeted at particular groups, such as school closures or social distancing by older people. Although we currently lack detailed empirical data about contact and infection rates between age groups and groups with different levels of healthcare access within New Zealand, these scenarios illustrate how such evidence could be used to inform specific interventions. We find that an increase in the transmission rates amongst children from reopening schools is unlikely to significantly increase the number of cases, unless this is accompanied by a change in adult behaviour. We also find that there is a risk of undetected outbreaks occurring in communities that have low access to healthcare and that are socially isolated from more privileged communities. The greater the degree of inequity and extent of social segregation, the longer it will take before any outbreaks are detected. Well-established evidence for health inequities, particularly in accessing primary healthcare and testing, indicates that Maori and Pacific peoples are at higher risk of undetected outbreaks in Aotearoa New Zealand. This highlights the importance of ensuring that community needs for access to healthcare, including early proactive testing, rapid contact tracing, and the ability to isolate, are being met equitably. Finally, these scenarios illustrate how information concerning contact and infection rates across different demographic groups may be useful in informing specific policy interventions.",21/05/2020,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,20/06/2022 0:36,,,,,,,A structured model for COVID-19 spread,,,,,Epidemiology,,en,,preprint,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,DOI: 10.1101/2020.05.17.20104976,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\FRL5NV68\James et al. - 2020 - A structured model for COVID-19 spread modelling .pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We model the testing, isolation and transmission of COVID-19 within quarantine facilities to estimate the risk of community outbreaks being seeded at the border. We use a simple branching process model for COVID-19 transmission that includes a time-dependent probability of a false negative test result. We show that the combination of 14-day quarantine with two tests reduces the risk of releasing an infectious case to around 0.1% per infected arrival. Shorter quarantine periods, or reliance on testing only with no quarantine, substantially increases this risk. We calculate the fraction of cases detected in the second week of their two week stay and show that this may be a useful indicator of the likelihood of transmission occurring within quarantine facilities. Frontline staff working at the border risk exposure to infected individuals and this has the potential to lead to a community outbreak. We use the model to test surveillance strategies and evaluate the likely size of the outbreak at the time it is first detected.

These include smartphone apps, Bluetooth-based proximity detection, location tracking, and automatic exposure notification features. Evidence on the effectiveness of alternative approaches to digital contact tracing is so far limited.                                   Methods             We use an age-structured branching process model of the transmission of COVID-19 in different settings to estimate the potential of manual contact tracing and digital tracing systems to help control the epidemic. We investigate the effect of the uptake rate and proportion of contacts recorded by the digital system on key model outputs: the effective reproduction number, the mean outbreak size after 30 days, and the probability of elimination.                                   Results             Effective manual contact tracing can reduce the effective reproduction number from 2.4 to around 1.5. The addition of a digital tracing system with a high uptake rate over 75% could further reduce the effective reproduction number to around 1.1.

DX3FC4GS,report,2020,"James, Alex; Hendy, Shaun C.; Plank, Michael J.; Steyn, Nicholas",Suppression and Mitigation Strategies for Control of COVID-19 in New Zealand,,,,,http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044677,"Abstract           A standard SEIR-type compartment model, parameterised for New Zealand, was used to simulate the spread of Covid19 in New Zealand and to test the effectiveness of various control strategies. Control aims can be broadly categorised as either suppression or mitigation. Suppression aims to keep cases to an absolute minimum for as long as possible. Mitigation aims to allow a controlled outbreak to occur, with the aim of preventing significant overloads on healthcare systems and gradually allowing the population to develop herd immunity.           Both types of strategy are fraught with uncertainty. Suppression strategies can succeed in delaying an outbreak, but only for as long as such control measures can be sustained. Once controls are eased or restricted, an epidemic is likely to follow as no herd immunity has been acquired. The success or failure of mitigation strategies can depend sensitively on the timing and efficacy of control measures, and require the ability to bring rapidly growing outbreaks under immediate control when needed. This is as yet untested even for a combination of national interventions including case isolation, household quarantine, population-wide social distancing and closure of schools and universities.           Although there are disadvantages to both types of approach, suppression has the advantage of buying time until a vaccine and/or treatment become available and allowing NZ to learn from rapidly unfolding events in other countries. A combination of successful suppression, strong border measures, and widespread contact tracing and testing resulting in containment could allow periods when control measures can be relaxed, but only if cases are reduced to a handful.                        Executive Summary                                             Suppression strategies aim to keep the number of cases to an absolute minimum for as long as possible. This requires early and effective control interventions.                                               Suppression can only delay an epidemic, not prevent it, but may buy enough time for a vaccine or treatment to become available.                                               Mitigation strategies aim to control an epidemic so that herd immunity is acquired by the population without overwhelming healthcare systems.                                               Mitigation strategies are likely to be very high risk: they are unproven internationally, potentially sensitive to uncertainty, and it may take years for herd immunity to be acquired.                                               Strategy can be switched from suppression to mitigation. For example, once successful mitigation strategies have been tested in other countries. It is likely to be difficult or impossible to switch from a mitigation to a suppression strategy.

Once new cases are no longer detected over consecutive days, the probability of elimination is an important measure for informing decisions on when certain COVID-19 restrictions should be relaxed. Our model of COVID-19 spread in New Zealand estimates that after 2-3 weeks of no new reported cases, there is a 95% probability that COVID-19 has been eliminated. We assessed the sensitivity of this estimate to varying model parameters, in particular to different likelihoods of detection of clinical cases and different levels of control effectiveness. Under an optimistic scenario with high detection of clinical cases, a 95% probability of elimination is achieved after 10 consecutive days with no new reported cases, while under a more pessimistic scenario with low case detection it is achieved after 22 days.",11/08/2020,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,20/06/2022 0:36,,,,,,,,,,,,Epidemiology,,en,,preprint,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,DOI: 10.1101/2020.08.10.20172361,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\7TMWV749\Binny et al. - 2020 - Probability of elimination for COVID-19 in Aotearo.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use a stochastic model to investigate containment and elimination scenarios for COVID-19 in New Zealand, as the country considers the exit from its four week period of strong Level 4 population-wide control measures. In particular we consider how the effectiveness of its case isolation operations influence the outcome of lifting these strong population-wide controls. The model is parameterised for New Zealand and is initialised using current case data, although we do not make use of information concerning the geographic dispersion of cases and the model is not stratified for age or co-morbidities. We find that fast tracing and case isolation (i.e. operations that are sustained at rates comparable to that at the early stages of New Zealand’s response) can lead to containment or elimination, as long as strong population-wide controls remain in place. Slow case isolation can lead to containment (but not elimination) as long as strong Level 4 population-wide controls remain in place. However, we find that relaxing strong population-wide controls after four weeks will most likely lead to a further outbreak, although the speed of growth of this outbreak can be reduced by fast case isolation, by tracing, testing, or otherwise. We find that elimination is only likely if case isolation is combined with strong population-wide controls that are maintained for longer than four weeks. Further versions of this model will include an age-structured population as well as considering the effects of geographic dispersion and contact network structure, the possibility of regional containment combined with inter-regional travel restrictions, and the potential for harm to at risk communities and essential workers. Executive SummaryWhile New Zealand case numbers remain low, tracing, testing, and rapid case isolation, combined with population-wide control methods, offer an opportunity for the country to contain and eliminate COVID-19.Simulations using our model suggest that the current population-wide controls (Alert Level 4) have already had a significant effect on new case numbers (see figure below). <img class=""highwire-fragment fragment-image"" alt=""Figure"" src=""https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/04/11/2020.04.08.20058743/F1.medium.gif"" width=""440"" height=""229""/>Download figureOpen in new tabWe also find that fast case isolation, whether as a result of contact tracing, rapid testing, or otherwise, can lead to containment and possibly even elimination, when combined with strong population-wide controls.Slow case isolation can also lead to containment, but only as long as strong population wide controls remain in place.

This study documents the first attempt to map soil pH (1:5 H2O) at high resolution (100 m) in New Zealand. The regression framework used follows the paradigm of digital soil mapping, and a limited number of environmental covariates were selected using variable selection, before calibration of a quantile regression forest model. In order to adapt the outcomes of this work to a wide range of different depth supports, a new approach, which includes depth of sampling as a covariate, is proposed. It relies on data augmentation, a process where virtual observations are drawn from statistical populations constructed using the observed data, based on the top and bottom depth of sampling, and including the uncertainty surrounding the soil pH measurement. A single model can then be calibrated and deployed to estimate pH a various depths. Results showed that the data augmentation routine had a beneficial effect on prediction uncertainties, in particular when reference measurement uncertainties are taken into account. Further testing found that the optimal rate of augmentation for this dataset was 3-fold. Inspection of the final model revealed that the most important variables for predicting soil pH distribution in New Zealand were related to land cover and climate, in particular to soil water balance. The evaluation of this approach on those validation sites set aside before modelling showed very good results (R2=0.65, CCC=0.79, RMSE=0.54), that significantly out-performed existing soil pH information for the country.",4/09/2020,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,20/06/2022 0:36,2872,,18,12,,Remote Sensing,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\BESL2AAA\Roudier et al. - 2020 - National Scale 3D Mapping of Soil pH Using a Data .pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, although hand washing, social distancing and bubble living have been widely adopted by the ‘team of 5 million’, mass masking has not been socialised to the general population. AIMTo identify factors associated with face masking in New Zealand during COVID-19 Alert Level 4 lockdown to inform strategies to socialise and support mass masking. METHODSA quantitative online survey conducted in New Zealand during April 2020 invited residents aged ≥18 years to complete a questionnaire. Questions about face masking were included in the survey. The sample was drawn from a commissioned research panel survey, with boosted sampling for Māori and Pacific participants. Responses were weighted to reflect the New Zealand population for all analyses. RESULTSA total of 1015 individuals participated. Self-reported beliefs were strongly related to behaviours, with respondents viewing face masking measures as ‘somewhat’ or ‘very’ effective in preventing them from contracting COVID-19 more likely to report having worn a face mask than respondents who viewed them as ‘not at all’ effective. The strongest barriers to face mask use included beliefs that there was a mask shortage and that the needs of others were greater than their own.

The requirement to “shelter in place” for eight weeks nationwide, with only “essential services” operating, affected all parts of the New Zealand food system. The nationwide full lockdown highlighted existing inequities and created new challenges to food access, availability, affordability, distribution, transportation, and waste management. While Aotearoa New Zealand is a food producer, there remains uncertainty surrounding the future of local food systems, particularly as the long-term effects of the pandemic emerge. In this article we draw on interviews with food rescue groups, urban farms, community organisations, supermarket management, and local and central government staff to highlight the diverse, rapid, community-based responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings reveal shifts at both the local scale, where existing relationships and short supply chains have been leveraged quickly, and national scale, where funding has been mobilised towards a different food strategy.

Understanding               in vivo               stimuli affecting the biofilm cycle is one step toward targeted prevention strategies. Iron restriction by the host is a stimulus for biofilm formation for some               Staphylococcus aureus               isolates; however, in some infection scenarios bacteria are exposed to abundant amounts of hemoglobin (Hb), which               S. aureus               is able to use as iron source. Thus, we hypothesized a role for Hb in the biofilm infection. Microplate “biofilm” assays showed biofilm-matrix production was increased in the presence of hemoglobin when compared to the provision of iron as an inorganic salt. Microscopic analysis of biofilms showed that the provision of iron as hemoglobin consistently caused thicker and more structured biofilms when compared to the effect of the inorganic iron source. Iron responsive biofilm gene expression analysis showed that Agr Quorum Sensing, a known biofilm dispersal marker, was repressed with hemoglobin but induced with an equivalent amount of inorganic iron in the laboratory strain Newman. The gene expression of two biofilm structuring agents, PSMα and PSMβ, differed in the response to the iron source provided and was not correlated to hemoglobin-structured biofilms. A comparison of the model pathogen               S. aureus               Newman with local clinical isolates demonstrated that while there was a similar phenotypic biofilm response to hemoglobin, there was substantial variation in the expression of key biofilm dispersal markers, suggesting an underappreciated variation in biofilm regulome among               S. aureus               isolates and that no general inferences can be made by studying the behavior of single strains.",21/12/2020,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,20/06/2022 0:35,509525,,,11,,Front.

Mixed-method bicultural research in Aotearoa New Zealand, including the weaving of Indigenous and other knowledge, is emerging within many academic disciplines. However, mātauranga Māori (the knowledge, culture, values, and world view of the Indigenous peoples of Aotearoa New Zealand) and Te Ao Māori (the Māori world) is poorly represented within geomorphological investigations. Here, we review international efforts to include Indigenous knowledge in geologic and geomorphic studies and provide an overview of the current state of mātauranga Māori within research endeavours in Aotearoa New Zealand. We review three theoretical frameworks (i.e. methodologies) for including mātauranga Māori in research projects and three models (i.e. methods) for including Māori values within research. We identify direct benefits to geomorphology and discuss how these frameworks and models can be adapted for use with Indigenous knowledge systems outside of Aotearoa New Zealand. The aim of this review is to encourage geomorphologists around the world to engage with local Indigenous peoples to develop new approaches to geomorphic research. In Aotearoa New Zealand, we hope to inspire geomorphologists to embark on research journeys in genuine partnership with Māori that promote toitū te mātauranga – the enduring protection, promotion and respect of mātauranga Māori.",16/07/2020,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,20/06/2022 0:36,595-618,,3,8,,Earth Surf.

In 2013 an ice core was recovered from Roosevelt Island, an ice dome between two submarine troughs carved by paleo-ice-streams in the Ross Sea, Antarctica. The ice core is part of the Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution (RICE) project and provides new information about the past configuration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and its retreat during the last deglaciation. In this work we present the RICE17 chronology, which establishes the depth–age relationship for the top 754 m of the 763 m core. RICE17 is a composite chronology combining annual layer interpretations for 0–343 m (Winstrup et al., 2019) with new estimates for gas and ice ages based on synchronization of CH4 and δ18Oatm records to corresponding records from the WAIS Divide ice core and by modeling of the gas age–ice age difference. Novel aspects of this work include the following: (1) an automated algorithm for multiproxy stratigraphic synchronization of high-resolution gas records; (2) synchronization using centennial-scale variations in methane for pre-anthropogenic time periods (60–720 m, 1971 CE to 30 ka), a strategy applicable for future ice cores; and (3) the observation of a continuous climate record back to ∼65 ka providing evidence that the Roosevelt Island Ice Dome was a constant feature throughout the last glacial period.",2/09/2020,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,20/06/2022 0:35,1691-1713,,5,16,,Clim.

Irruptions of generalist consumers and corresponding generalist predators often follow such resource pulses. This can have severe implications on the ecosystem and also on the spread of diseases or on regional famines. Suitable management strategies are necessary to deal with these systems. In this study, we develop a general model to investigate optimal control for such a system and apply this to a case study from New Zealand. In particular, we consider the dynamics of beech masting (episodic synchronous seed production) leading to rodent outbreaks and subsequent stoat (               Mustela erminea               ) irruptions. Here, stoat control happens via secondary poisoning. The results show that the main driver of the optimal control timing (June) is the population density of the control vector. Intermediate control levels are superior to higher levels if the generalist consumer is necessary as a control vector. Finally, we extend the model to a two-patch metapopulation model, which indicates that, as a consequence of the strong vector dependence, a strategy of alternating control patches yields better results than static control. This highlights that besides control level, also the design impacts the control success. The results presented in this study reveal important insights for proper pest management in the New Zealand case study. However, they also generally indicate the necessity of tailored control in such systems.",2020-06,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,20/06/2022 0:36,261-275,,2,13,,Theor Ecol,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\5XSFQFSX\Köhnke et al. - 2020 - The necessity of tailored control of irrupting pes.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This causal relationship is further complicated by the multi-level social determinants such as socio-political context, socio-economic factors and health systems. The systems approach has potential to facilitate understanding of such complex causal mechanisms. The objective of this paper is to describe the role of tobacco and alcohol use in the interaction of social determinants of NCDs in Nepal.                                         Method                                The study adopted a qualitative study design guided by the                 Systemic Intervention                 methodology. The study involved key informant interviews (                 n                  = 63) and focus group discussions (                 n                  = 12) at different levels (national, district and/or community) and was informed by the adapted                 Social Determinants of Health Framework                 .

Results               Three key themes and causal loop diagrams emerged from the data analysis. Widespread availability of tobacco and alcohol products contributed to the use and addiction of tobacco and alcohol. Low focus on primary prevention by health systems and political influence of tobacco and alcohol industries were the major contributors to the problem. Gender and socio-economic status of families/communities were identified as key social determinants of tobacco and alcohol use.                                         Conclusion               Tobacco and alcohol use facilitated interaction of the social determinants of NCDs in the context of Nepal. Socio-economic status of families was both driver and outcome of tobacco and alcohol use. Health system actions to prevent NCDs were delayed mainly due to lack of system insights and commercial influence.

We use lake sediments to reconstruct a quantitative, multiproxy hydroclimate sequences from Vanuatu, Samoa, and the Southern Cook Islands and combine these with published data to show that the timing of human migration into East Polynesia coincided with a prolonged drought. We postulate this regional drought was a significant contributory factor in eastward exploration and subsequent colonization of the Southern Cook Islands and beyond. The return of wetter conditions in East Polynesia after c. AD 1150 supported subsequent colonization of other central islands and, eventually, migration into far eastern and South Polynesia.           ,              The timing of human colonization of East Polynesia, a vast area lying between Hawai‘i, Rapa Nui, and New Zealand, is much debated and the underlying causes of this great migration have been enigmatic. Our study generates evidence for human dispersal into eastern Polynesia from islands to the west from around AD 900 and contemporaneous paleoclimate data from the likely source region. Lake cores from Atiu, Southern Cook Islands (SCIs) register evidence of pig and/or human occupation on a virgin landscape at this time, followed by changes in lake carbon around AD 1000 and significant anthropogenic disturbance from c. AD 1100. The broader paleoclimate context of these early voyages of exploration are derived from the Atiu lake core and complemented by additional lake cores from Samoa (directly west) and Vanuatu (southwest) and published hydroclimate proxies from the Society Islands (northeast) and Kiribati (north). Algal lipid and leaf wax biomarkers allow for comparisons of changing hydroclimate conditions across the region before, during, and after human arrival in the SCIs. The evidence indicates a prolonged drought in the likely western source region for these colonists, lasting c. 200 to 400 y, contemporaneous with the phasing of human dispersal into the Pacific. We propose that drying climate, coupled with documented social pressures and societal developments, instigated initial eastward exploration, resulting in SCI landfall(s) and return voyaging, with colonization a century or two later.

The model can predict changes in proficiency levels over time and, ultimately, whether a given endangered language is on a long-term trajectory towards extinction or recovery. We calibrate the model using data from Wales and show that the model predicts that the Welsh language will thrive in the long term. We then apply the model to te reo Māori, the indigenous language of New Zealand, as a case study. Initial conditions for this model are estimated using New Zealand census data.

This promotes break-up of the dimer into isolated spheres.           ,              Amphiphilic Janus particles in a flow are thought to experience a torque due to the asymmetry in slip at their surfaces. This effect has the potential to destabilise self-assembled Janus structures in flows due to the forces and torques applied to individual Janus nanoparticles. In this work, we investigate the stability of amphiphilic Janus dimers and homogeneous hydrophobic dimers in shear flow using molecular dynamics, and study possible break-up mechanisms. In particular, we consider the influence of the activation enthalpy and entropy on the thermal break-up rate of these dimers. Janus dimers are less stable than hydrophobic dimers, and increasing the applied shear rate has a greater effect on break-up for Janus dimers. Two mechanisms leading to increased break-up in shear flow are studied, namely the rotational speed of the dimers and the orientation of individual spheres in the dimers, and we propose a descriptive equation for calculation of the break-up rate. Overall, the results indicate that the stability of dimers in shear flow depends on the slip length at the spheres' surfaces, and that the slip length difference on Janus dimers could contribute to destabilisation.",2020,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,20/06/2022 0:36,7116-7125,,30,16,,Soft Matter,Stability of amphiphilic Janus dimers in shear flow,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Developed world fisheries tend to fish more selectively, concentrating on certain species and sizes preferred in the market. However, fishing patterns in some developing countries, with a range of different fishing gears and more generalist markets, more closely resemble BH. The BH debate therefore hinges on whether selective fisheries should become more balanced, whether unselective fisheries should do the opposite, both, or neither. In this study, we use simple and general analytical theory to describe the ideal free distribution that should emerge in unmanaged fisheries, and we show that this ideal free distribution should approximately produce BH only when prices, catchabilities, and fishing costs are similar across species and sizes. We then derive general properties of yield and profit maxima subject to conservation constraints. We find that BH is unlikely to be optimal in any fishery but may be closer to optimal in fisheries in which it emerges without management. Thus, BH may be more useful as a heuristic for understanding differences between fisheries in locally appropriate management than as an exact management strategy.",1/05/2020,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,20/06/2022 0:36,901-910,,3,77,,,What unmanaged fishing patterns reveal about optimal management,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\XDWCJREU\Burgess and Plank - 2020 - What unmanaged fishing patterns reveal about optim.pdf,,,,"Andersen, Ken",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article reviews what we have learned over the past century about the large-scale outcome of health inequality, and what we know about the behaviour of complex social systems. This combined knowledge provides lessons on the nature of inequality and what effective action on our big goals, like the SDGs, might look like. It argues that economic theories and positivist social theories which have dominated the last 150 years have largely excluded the nature of human connections to each other, and the environment. This exclusion of intimacy has legitimatised arguments that only value-free economic processes matter for macro human systems, and only abstract measurement constitutes valuable social science. Theories of complex systems provide an alternative perspective. One where health inequality is viewed as emergent, and causes are systemic and compounding. Action therefore needs to be intensely local, with power relationships key to transformation. This requires conscious and difficult intervention on the intolerable accumulation of resources; improved reciprocity between social groups; and reversal of system flows, which at present ebb away from the local and those already disadvantaged.",14/04/2020,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,20/06/2022 0:36,2684,,8,17,,IJERPH,Health Inequality as a Large-Scale Outcome of Complex Social Systems,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\RK2E8LVS\Matheson - 2020 - Health Inequality as a Large-Scale Outcome of Comp.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, co-authorship networks are, in fact, one-mode projections of original bipartite networks, which we call here scientific networks, where authors are agents connected to artifacts - the papers they have published. Nonetheless, few studies take into account the structure of the original bipartite network to understand and explain the topological properties of the projected network. Here, we create bipartite networks using extensive datasets from the American Physical Society (APS) dating back to 1893 up to 2015 inclusive, and from arXiv (1986-2015). We look at the time evolution of publications and at the dynamic structure of scientific networks considering four major features of bipartite networks, namely degree distributions, density, redundancy and cycles. We show how such features shape the formation of co-authorship networks and their observed structural properties. While the structure of the networks of most disciplines does not show significant changes over time, the appearance of large collaborations, in physics, generate largely skewed degree distributions of top nodes. The latter, in turn, induces massive cliques in the projection, triggering considerable densification of the co-authorship network, while the density of the original bipartite network remains at the same levels.",27/05/2020,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,20/06/2022 0:34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,arxiv.org,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\DW3M9WEH\Filho and O'Neale - 2020 - Structure dynamics of evolving scientific networks.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\YLETG4G7\2005.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, questions on why most social networks present some particular structural features, namely, high levels of transitivity and degree assortativity, when compared to other types of networks remain open. First, we argue that every one-mode network can be regarded as a projection of a bipartite network, and we show that this is the case using two simple examples solved with the generating functions formalism. Second, using synthetic and empirical data, we reveal how the combination of the degree distribution of both sets of nodes of the bipartite network—together with the presence of cycles of lengths four and six—explain the observed values of transitivity and degree assortativity coefficients in the one-mode projected network.

We explore the interdependence between evolving citation and co-authorship networks focused on the publications, by Indian authors, in American Physical Society journals between 1970 and 2013. We record interactions between each possible pair of authors in two ways: first, by tracing the change in citations, they exchanged and, second, by tracing the shortest path between authors in the co-authorship network. We create these data for every year of the period of our analysis. We use probability methods to quantify the correlation between citations and shortest paths, and the effect on the dynamics of the citation-co-authorship system. We find that author pairs who have a co-authorship distance $$d \le 3$$significantly affect each other’s citations, but that this effect falls off rapidly for longer distances in the co-authorship network. The exchange of citation between pairs with $$d=1$$exhibits a sudden increase at the time of first co-authorship events and decays thereafter, indicating an ageing effect in collaboration. This behaviour suggests that the dynamics of the co-authorship network appear to be driving those of the citation network rather than vice versa. Moreover, the majority of citations received by most authors are due to reciprocal citations from current, or past, co-authors. We conclude that, in order to answer questions on the nature and dynamics of scientific collaboration, it is necessary to study both co-authorship and citation network simultaneously.",1/10/2020,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,17/06/2022 1:07,385-404,,1,125,,Scientometrics,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\H3NT6SE8\Singh et al. - 2020 - Evolution of interdependent co-authorship and cita.pdf,,,Evolution; Citation networks; Co-authorship networks; Network structure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With increasingly digital societies, individuals have become more familiar and comfortable in using Online Social Networks (OSNs) for just about every aspect of their lives. This higher level of comfort leads to users spilling their emotions on OSNs and eventually their private information. In this work, we aim to investigate the relationship between users' emotions and private information in their tweets. Our research question is whether users' emotions, expressed in their tweets, affect their likelihood to reveal their own private information (privacy leakage) in subsequent tweets. In contrast to existing survey-based approaches, we use an inductive, data-driven approach to answer our research question. We use state-of-the-art techniques to classify users' emotions, and privacy scoring and employ a new technique involving BERT for binary detection of sensitive data. We use two parallel classification frameworks: one that takes the user's emotional state into account and the other for the detection of sensitive data in tweets. Consecutively, we identify individual cases of correlation between the two. We bring the two classifiers together to interpret the changes in both factors over time during a conversation between individuals. Variations were found with respect to the kinds of private information revealed in different states. Our results show that being in negative emotional states, such as sadness, anger or fear, leads to higher privacy leakage than otherwise.",2020-12,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,1228-1235,,,,,,Do My Emotions Influence What I Share?,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,ISSN: 2324-9013,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\ZXKY5SDV\9343194.html,,,Blogs; Conferences; Correlation; Data privacy; Emotions; Privacy; Security; Social networking (online); Twitter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2020 IEEE 19th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (TrustCom)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, such `edges' in the data can be a useful way to partition the feature space in order to train specialised learners for individual regions. This is particularly beneficial where these regions are relatively simple, and hence low-complexity learners can be used successfully on them. Another benefit of such an approach is that it is easily parallelisable: the specialised learners use independent partitions of the data, and so they can be trained in parallel, while output prediction is based on the output of just one network, so there is no need to combine predictions. We introduce an algorithm to partition the data that is inspired by Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting. Using an implementation based on a decision tree with neural networks at the leaves, we demonstrate our approach for regression learning on patches of the feature space. We use both artificial and real-world datasets to show that, in some use cases, this method can outperform conventional neural networks that see the entire feature set in the original training.",2020-12,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,1786-1793,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,,,,,,Training; Neurons; Prediction algorithms; Biological neural networks; decision trees; discontinuous functions; Finite element analysis; finite elements; neural networks; Partitioning algorithms; regression learning; Response surface methodology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WRP is a classical path planning problem, asking for the minimum cost path between two given points crossing different regions in which each region is assigned a traversal cost per unit distance. Although WRP has been studied for decades, the exact solution for WRP, even in a two-dimensional environment, is unknown. Thus, the existing solutions for WRP are all approximations with decomposition-based and heuristic methods being the most widely-used in practice. However, when a very-close to optimal path is required, especially on real terrains with many regions, these approaches are not guaranteed or cannot return a satisfactory result in reasonable time. In this paper, we first present a new algorithm of finding a very-close optimal path, based on a user-defined parameter δ, between two points, crossing the surface of a sequence of regions in 3D, using Snell's law of physical refraction. We then show how to combine this algorithm with one existing decomposition-based method to compute a close optimal path over the whole terrain. In addition to a theoretical analysis, with an extensive set of test cases, the practicality and feasibility of our method are confirmed by that, our method always runs faster and returns closer to optimal paths in comparison with the existing ones.",3/11/2020,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,19/06/2022,597–607,,,,,,,SIGSPATIAL '20,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,least cost path; Weighted regions; weighted shortest path,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also examine the moderating effect of the market capitalisation of stocks on the strength of this relationship. Using data collected from a well-known equity research platform, we demonstrate that the size of the market cap plays an important role in this relationship. The smaller the market cap, the higher the predicting power of the social media sentiment on stock abnormal returns.

We have investigated the effect of the social structure of an OSS project on project popularity among community members. Data from GitHub is used to construct two different types of social networks for each project. The affiliation network represents the developers’ inter-project relationships and following network reveals intra-project relationship. Applying the lenses of social network theory, we examine the effect of embeddedness and cohesion of the project’s contributors on project popularity.

However, many bioarchaeological signatures used to examine the effect of environmental change on humans also occur on other animals. These common indicators, when studied on domesticates and commensals, can serve as different lenses on past environmental conditions and can provide a detailed insight into the interplay between humans and other animals. Overlap and variability between species in diet or developmental stresses can be indicative of general conditions that may have affected all species, as well as the specific ecological interactions and consequences for individual species. Thus multiple species analysis is useful for identifying major environmental stressors that affected all species versus cases where humans offset stresses through modifications to environments such as changes in husbandry. In this chapter, we outline this particular multi-species approach and review its use in Oceania focusing upon analyses of stable isotopes, dental pathology, and enamel hypoplasia. Interpretive difficulties can arise from the nature of animal and human assemblages and variability in animal life histories and physiological responses to stressors. Yet the studies discussed here reveal how the multispecies approach can aid understanding of the evolving human niche, and environmental change more broadly.",2020,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,,,,,,,Human–animal entanglements and environmental change,,,,,Routledge,,,,,,,,,Num Pages: 18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2KYMHQU5,report,2019,"Kerr, Suzi; Leining, Catherine","Uncertainty, Risk and Investment and the NZ ETS",,,,,https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3477062,"New Zealand is facing a challenging low-emission transition, and effective emission pricing needs to be part of the solution. In its pure form, an emissions trading system (ETS) fixes the quantity of emissions in regulated sectors and the market sets the emission price. In New Zealand’s current policy and market context, there is value in managing both unit supply and emission prices under the NZ ETS. While emission price changes in response to policy and market conditions are desirable to drive efficient abatement, excessive price instability can deter low-emission investment. This working paper, which evolved under Motu’s ETS Dialogue process from 2016 to 2018, explores key considerations for emission price management in the context of a specific working model for unit supply in the NZ ETS. Emission price instability can be reduced at its source by reinforcing policy commitment and improving market regulation and development. Emission price instability can be mitigated by incorporating a price ceiling (cost containment reserve backed by a fixed-price option) and a price floor (auction reserve price) into the auction mechanism. Decisions on price management should be coordinated with other decisions affecting unit supply, guided by an indicative ten-year trajectory for both unit supply and emission prices, and informed by independent advice. Two companion working papers address interactions between ETS price management and the choice of cap and linking to overseas markets. The three working papers elaborate on an integrated proposal for managing unit supply, prices, and linking in the NZ ETS that was presented in Kerr et al.

3BGB3VGQ,report,2019,"Kerr, Suzi; Leining, Catherine",Paying for Mitigation: How New Zealand Can Contribute to Others’ Efforts,,,,,https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3477065,"Purchasing international emission reductions (IERs) can help New Zealand make a more ambitious and cost-effective contribution toward global climate change mitigation and support developing countries in accelerating their low-emission transition. However, New Zealand must avoid past mistakes by ensuring international purchasing does not derail its own decarbonisation pathway. Furthermore, the Paris Agreement has fundamentally changed how countries will trade IERs over the 2021–30 period. This working paper, which evolved under Motu’s ETS Dialogue process from 2016 to 2018, focuses on how we can balance our international and domestic mitigation efforts. It explores how many IERs we may want, how we should integrate international mitigation support with participants’ obligations under the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ ETS), and what mechanisms we can use to fund international mitigation effectively. Fundamentally, the New Zealand government will need to ensure that all IERs counted toward its targets and accepted in the NZ ETS have environmental integrity and are both approved and not double counted by seller and buyer governments. This paper presents a working model for New Zealand’s purchase of IERs, in which the quantity is controlled by government, purchasing is managed by government for the foreseeable future (with potential participation by private entities), and the quantity is factored into decisions on the NZ ETS cap and price management mechanisms. If NZ ETS participants are able to purchase IERs in the future, then a quantity limit should apply as a percentage of the surrender obligation and the volume should offset other supply under the cap. The paper also highlights an innovative “climate team” mechanism for international climate change cooperation that could facilitate purchasing by the New Zealand government.

The term ‘welfare’ has existed in the NZOYBs and Hansard text since the start of our analysis (1893), with a steadily increasing trend until the mid-1980s. The term ‘wellbeing’ gained momentum in mid-1930s and has been linked strongly with ‘sustainability’ in the following decades. Our analysis re-emphasizes the importance of the Brundtland Report (‘Our Common Future’) which acted as a catalyst to the sustainable movement in late 1980s. ‘Sustainability’ and ‘wellbeing’ then began to appear in conjunction.

8DMZDZVG,report,2019,"Leining, Catherine; Kerr, Suzi",Managing Scarcity and Ambition in the NZ ETS,,,,,https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3477060,"The fundamental purpose of an emissions trading system (ETS) is to constrain emissions and enable the market to set an emissions price path that facilitates an effective transition to a lowemissions economy. In a conventional ETS, the emissions constraint is defined by a cap (a fixed limit) on tradable, government-issued emission units together with a quantity limit on any external units allowed in the system (e.g. via an offsets mechanism). Essentially, an ETS cap underpins the ambition, cost-effectiveness, distributional implications, and credibility of a jurisdiction’s approach to decarbonisation. From 2008 to mid-2015, the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ ETS) broke from convention by linking to the global Kyoto cap without its own limit on domestic emissions. NZ ETS participants met compliance obligations using unlimited overseas units at low prices and faced little incentive to reduce their own emissions. The NZ ETS delinked from the Kyoto market in mid-2015, creating uncertainty over the future of domestic unit supply and an efficient price path for domestic decarbonisation. This working paper, which evolved under Motu’s ETS Dialogue process from 2016 to 2018, explores key considerations for ETS cap setting and proposes the design for a cap on units auctioned and freely allocated in the NZ ETS. The recommendations focus on issues of cap architecture rather than ambition. The proposed cap is defined in tonnes of emissions per year, fixed for five years in advance, extended by one year each year, and guided by an indicative ten-year cap trajectory. The fixed cap and cap trajectory need to reflect consideration of New Zealand’s domestic decarbonisation objectives, international targets, mitigation potential and costs in both ETS and non-ETS sectors, and prospects for cost-effective investment in overseas emission reductions. Two companion working papers address how the choice of cap will interact with decisions on ETS price management mechanisms and linking to overseas markets.

We adapt the analytical framework of Roback (1982, 1988) and Chen & Rosenthal (2008) to estimate the impact of cultural diversity on city wage and rent premiums from hedonic regressions. We focus on New Zealand which – with high residential mobility and ease of setting up business – is particularly suited to this framework. Additionally, our estimates are based on a very large data set: complete unit record census data on individuals and dwellings in 110 urban areas spanning 32 years. Controlling for observed and unobserved city characteristics, and for the potential endogeneity of diversity, we find that cultural diversity serves as a local positive production amenity and a weakly negative consumption amenity. The results are mostly robust to measuring cultural diversity by birthplace, ethnicity or religion; and to using a range of measures of diversity. We conclude that the presence of people from different cultural backgrounds enhances the profitability of urban firms. In contrast, a city’s population has a weak preference for living near others who are culturally similar to them.

Nevertheless, we find that in their public health system employment female specialists earn an average of 12.5 percent less than their male counterparts of the same age, with the same specialty, and who work the same number of hours each week. This wage gap is larger for older ages, among those who work fewer hours each week, and for parents.

The QL and QB measures are constructed using (qualityadjusted) rents and wages in each city. QL and QB reflect the willingness to pay of households and firms, respectively, for local amenities. The measures are constructed for 31 urban areas in New Zealand using five-yearly census data covering 1986 to 2013. We adopt a gravity model of regional migration – augmented by destination and origin QL and QB – to model bilateral flows of working-age migrants (post tertiary education and pre-retirement age). We also model flows between urban and rural areas and flows for the urban areas to and from overseas locations. We find different attractors for international versus domestic migrants according to the type of city amenity.

Measured at the Territorial Local Authority and Auckland Ward (TAW) area level, we estimate the elasticity of house prices with respect to population is 0.4-0.65, similar but smaller elasticity of apartment prices, but find no evidence of any local population effects on rents. We also estimate the elasticity of housing quantity with respect to population of about 0.9. Although international migration flows are an important contributor to population fluctuations, we find little evidence of systematic effects of international or domestic migrant composition of the local population on prices or quantity. In particular, despite there being a strong correlation between immigration and house price changes nationally, there is no evidence that local house or apartment prices are positively related to the share of new immigrants in an area. Repeating the analysis for more narrowly defined areas within Auckland, we estimate a smaller house price elasticity with respect to population in the range 0–0.15.

Auckland is New Zealand's most diverse city, but the impacts of diversity are likely to be less if interactions between different groups are limited by spatial separation. Studies of spatial sociodemographic diversity generally measure the diversity of local areas based on who lives in them. In this study, we examine measures of exposure to local cultural diversity based on where people work as well as where they live. Our measure of cultural diversity is based on country of birth, with ethnicity breakdowns for the New Zealand (NZ) born. The study also examines whether the relationship between commuting and exposure to diversity differs between workers with different skills or types of job. The study focuses on diversity and commuting patterns within Auckland, using 2013 census microdata, and using local diversity measures calculated for each census area unit. We find that commuters who self-identify as NZ-born Europeans and residents born in England (together accounting for close to half of all commuters) are, of all cultural groups, the least exposed to diversity in the neighbourhoods where they live.

A review of infectious disease publications over 100 years,Epidemiology and Infection,,"0950-2688, 1469-4409",10.1017/S0950268818003552,https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0950268818003552/type/journal_article,"Abstract             In a rational world, scientific effort would reflect society's needs. We tested this hypothesis using the area of infectious diseases, where the research response to emerging threats has obvious potential to save lives through informing interventions such as vaccination and prevention policies. Pathogens continue to evolve, emerge and re-emerge and infectious diseases that were once common become less so or their global distribution changes. A question remains as to whether scientific endeavours can adapt. Here, we identified papers on infectious diseases published in the four highest ranking, health-related journals over the 118 years from 1900. Focussing on outbreak-related and burden of disease-related metrics over the two time periods, 1990 to 2017 and 1900 to 2017, our analyses suggest that there is little underrepresentation of important infectious diseases among top ranked journals. Encouragingly our results suggest the scientific process is largely self-correcting.",2019,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,17/06/2022 1:18,e114,,,147,,Epidemiol.

We show that the extent of the gender gap varies depending on the status of the position in question and there are simple steps that can be taken to improve diversity. We analyse data on the activities of over 30 science societies spanning four countries and five distinct discipline areas. Our results show that women tend to be equally represented in lower status roles and awards, e.g. student prizes and editorships, but under-represented in higher status roles, e.g. late-career awards and chief editorships. We develop a simple mathematical model to explore the role of homophily in decision making and quantify the effect of simple steps that can be taken to improve diversity.

In particular, we consider amphiphilic Janus nanospheres that have different slip boundary conditions on each hemisphere, and calculate the forces and torques experienced by them as a function of their orientation with respect to the flow direction. Furthermore, we examine nanoparticles that are deformed slightly from a spherical shape, and have no-slip boundary conditions.

Indeed, the study of shapes is an important part of many scientific fields, such as evolutionary biology, structural biology, image processing and archaeology. However, mathematical shape spaces are rather complicated and nonlinear. The most widely used methods of shape analysis, geometric morphometrics, treat the shapes as sets of points. Diffeomorphic methods consider the underlying curve rather than points, but have rarely been applied to real-world problems. Using a machine classifier, we tested the ability of several of these methods to describe and classify the shapes of a variety of organic and man-made objects. We find that one method, based on square-root velocity functions (SRVFs), outperforms all others, including a standard geometric morphometric method (eigenshapes), and that it is also superior to human experts using shape alone. When the SRVF approach is constrained to take account of homologous landmarks it can accurately classify objects of very different shapes. The SRVF method identifies a shortest path between shapes, and we show that this can be used to estimate the shapes of intermediate steps in evolutionary series. Diffeomorphic shape analysis methods, we conclude, now provide practical and effective solutions to many shape description and classification problems in the natural and human sciences.",12/10/2022,7/05/2023 7:51,7/05/2023 7:51,7/05/2023 7:51,20220493,,195,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon),,Publisher: Royal Society,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\NP9NURR5\Salili-James et al. - 2022 - Classifying organisms and artefacts by their outli.pdf,,,archaeology; biology; classification; diffeomorphisms; shape analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent developments in network science highlight that accounting for node metadata improves both our understanding of how nodes interact with one another, and the accuracy of link prediction. However, to predict interactions in a network within existing statistical and machine learning frameworks, we need to learn objects that rapidly grow in dimension with the number of nodes. Thus, the task becomes computationally and conceptually challenging for networks. Here, we present a new predictive procedure combining a statistical, low-rank graph embedding method with machine learning techniques which reduces substantially the complexity of the learning task and allows us to efficiently predict interactions from node metadata in bipartite networks. To illustrate its application on real-world data, we apply it to a large dataset of tourist visits across a country.

The concept has been present in the soil science literature since the late 1950s, proving to be a useful framework for generalising traditional soil survey maps. This concept is inherently multi-scale, and current approaches generally build either on existing soil maps, or on cluster analysis of environmental proxies of soil forming factors. In this study, in parallel with the concept of beta-diversity in numerical ecology, we built a soilscape regionalisation for New Zealand based on detecting the turnover in soil types along different environmental gradients. It was implemented using Gradient Forest, a method that analyses the frequency of species (in our case, soil type) turnover alongside such gradients, which are then ranked relative to their ecological (in our case, pedological) relevance. Based on this analysis, the environmental covariates were transformed to amplify their most important parts in terms of soil type turnover. The transformed variables were then segmented into contiguous regions, at three different levels of scale. Finally, hierarchical clustering was used to produce discrete soilscapes, at different scales, and for the entire country. This approach was developed using pseudo-observations derived from a national scale coverage of soil types, and validated using an independent set of actual soil profile observations. Validation results reveal strong agreement between the dissimilarity quantified between soilscapes and the taxonomic distance between actual soil profile observations (R = 0.61, P < 0.001). We expect the resulting layers from this soilscape delineation exercise to be used for a diverse suite of pedometrics applications, from stratifying soil sampling schemes, to optimising the soil survey boundaries, and for digital soil mapping.",1/03/2022,7/05/2023 7:50,7/05/2023 7:50,7/05/2023 7:50,115637,,,409,,Geoderma,Soilscapes of New Zealand,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\DDCU6D65\S0016706121007175.html,,,Beta diversity; Digital Soil Mapping; Gradient forest; Image segmentation; Pedogenic thresholds; Soilscapes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SIMS measure ice and ocean temperature via thermistor strings with many different methods for extracting sea-ice thickness from temperature existing. This study investigates: if thickness results from temperature recorded by SIMS of different designs, and analysed with different methods are comparable; which methods are recommended for their robustness, precision and accuracy and how they compare to independent thickness measurements; how otherwise unuseable data can be salvaged through specific SIMS designs. We present an analysis of fast-ice thickness calculated from SIMS deployed in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica and in the Chukchi Sea near Utqiaġvik, Alaska, over two decades. We find that median thicknesses derived by different methods agree within 1 ± 1.5 cm for McMurdo Sound and 2 ± 3 cm for Utqiaġvik. Thus, it is possible to confidently compare data collected from different stations and analysed with different methods.

Correspondingly, they are pooling products to quality-differentiated markets and offering quality-differentiated prices to farmers in multiple stages. Methodology/results: We propose a two-stage stochastic program to study the quality coordination problem in a setting where a co-op specifies a quality standard and offers a multistage payment scheme in its contract with multiple farmers who can exert quality-related effort and also show preference toward prompt payment timing. We first analyze a commonly adopted payment scheme, the pooling payment scheme, and then propose an improved payment scheme, the upfront incentive (UI) payment scheme. We find that the pooling payment scheme is able to coordinate the supply chain only when farmers’ time preference is higher than a threshold; otherwise, the scheme leads to the problem of over-motivation with respect to effort. However, the UI payment scheme can coordinate the supply chain unconditionally and is also robust to farmers heterogeneous in farm size. We further conduct two extensions, including farmers heterogeneous in farm size and dynamic market size. Managerial implications: The results provide guidance on a co-op’s contract design, including quality provision and payment mechanisms in multiple periods.

We use an age-structured branching process model of the transmission of COVID-19 in different settings to estimate the potential of manual contact tracing and digital tracing systems to help control the epidemic. We investigate the effect of the uptake rate and proportion of contacts recorded by the digital system on key model outputs: the effective reproduction number, the mean outbreak size after 30 days and the probability of elimination.Results. Effective manual contact tracing can reduce the effective reproduction number from 2.4 to around 1.5. The addition of a digital tracing system with a high uptake rate over 75% could further reduce the effective reproduction number to around 1.1.

Dog-human symbioses are correspondingly diverse, ranging from mutualistic to commensal to competitive. The Pacific Islands, and Polynesia in particular, offer a useful context in which to consider dog-human symbioses across varied socio-environmental settings. The translocation of domestic dogs across this oceanic region was underway more than two millennia ago, if not earlier, with dogs established on numerous Pacific Islands. However, occasionally dogs were subsequently extirpated, a situation often attributed to competition between dogs and their human managers. Here we focus on how the dog-human symbiosis shifted as colonists moved from the small, environmentally-circumscribed, islands of tropical central Polynesia, to the largest, most ecologically diverse landmasses in the region—the islands of Aotearoa New Zealand. We hypothesize that the mid-13th century settlement of Aotearoa New Zealand initially resulted in competitive release for Polynesian dogs (i.e., relaxation of competition with humans) but as large native prey were depleted, and human communities economically reorganised, dog-human competition arose anew. These two hypotheses are evaluated using: a) country-wide data on dog distributions and abundance over time; and b) a regionally focused analysis of dental markers relating to dog diet and health. Our results support the hypothesis of competitive release on entry to Aotearoa New Zealand; dogs were quickly distributed across the two main islands, onto many large offshore islands, and into varied ecological niches—where they were generally well represented and associated with human occupations. This situation appears to have been followed by interspecific competition midway through the Māori sequence (ca. AD 1450–1650), when both dog assemblages and dog abundances are poorly represented. From the mid-17th century, dog population rebound is suggested, possibly accompanied by new husbandry practices. These trends are not, however, well reflected in the regionally focused dental marker analysis, where good oral health and adequate nutrition are indicated. Published studies of dog coprolites and stable isotopes analyses help flesh out the dental analyses and point to avenues of future study. Our research gives new insights into variability in dog-human symbioses across the Pacific Islands and potentially elsewhere, with a particular focus on the conditions that give rise to competition and the value of multi-proxy analyses in unravelling these complex entanglements.",1/03/2022,7/05/2023 7:33,7/05/2023 7:33,7/05/2023 7:33,105556,,,139,,Journal of Archaeological Science,Canine companions or competitors?,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\PHQA5R6A\S0305440322000140.html,,,Anthropogenic niche; Aotearoa New Zealand; Canis lupus familiaris; Competitive release; Dental markers; Interspecific (dog-human) competition; Multi-proxy analyses; Polynesian dog (kurī),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We further examined changes in population size and range shifts of species pools, and related these to taxonomy and functional traits. We found increasing climate and land-use driven differences in both the taxonomic and functional composition of communities over time, coupled with poleward species colonisations and increasing extirpations in northern locations. Increases in population and species range size were more prevalent than decreases in population and range size. Species shifted their ranges towards higher latitudes on average by 50 km per decade. Despite little to no relationship with taxonomy, we uncovered distinct relationships between functional traits and population trends and latitudinal species range shifts.

Borneo hunter–gatherers (Punan, Penan) have seldom figured in comparative research because of a decades-old controversy about whether they are the descendants of farmers who adopted a hunting and gathering way of life. In 2018 we began an ethnographic study of a group of still-nomadic hunter–gatherers who call themselves Punan Batu (Cave Punan). Our genetic analysis clearly indicates that they are very unlikely to be the descendants of neighbouring agriculturalists. They also preserve a song language that is unrelated to other languages of Borneo. Dispersed travelling groups of Punan Batu with fluid membership use message sticks to stay in contact, co-operate and share resources as they journey between rock shelters and forest camps. Message sticks were once widespread among nomadic Punan in Borneo, but have largely disappeared in sedentary Punan villages. Thus the small community of Punan Batu offers a rare glimpse of a hunting and gathering way of life that was once widespread in the forests of Borneo, where prosocial behaviour extended beyond the face-to-face community, facilitating successful collective adaptation to the diverse resources of Borneo's forests.",2022,7/05/2023 4:54,7/05/2023 4:54,7/05/2023 4:54,e9,,,4,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Cambridge University Press,,Publisher: Cambridge University Press,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\LQ2HVB5Z\Lansing et al. - 2022 - Deep ancestry of collapsing networks of nomadic hu.pdf,,,Austronesia; Borneo; Hunter–gatherers; prosocial behaviour; song language,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we use data on the democratic status of 221 modern and historical nations stretching back up to 200 years to show that, particularly over the last 50 years, nations with shared linguistic and, more recently, religious ancestry have more similar democratic outcomes. We also find evidence that for most of the last 50 years the democratic trajectory of a nation can be predicted by the democratic status of its linguistic and, less clearly, religious relatives, years and even decades earlier. These results are broadly consistent across three democracy indicators (Polity 5, Vanhanen's Index of Democracy, and Freedom in the World) and are not explained by geographical proximity or current shared language or religion. Our findings suggest that deep cultural ancestry remains an important force shaping the fortunes of modern nations, at least in part because democratic norms, institutions, and the factors that support them are more likely to diffuse between close cultural relatives.",2022,7/05/2023 4:53,7/05/2023 4:53,7/05/2023 4:53,e42,,,4,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Cambridge University Press,,Publisher: Cambridge University Press,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\DV6VA5IX\Kyritsis et al. - 2022 - Shared cultural ancestry predicts the global diffu.pdf,,,cultural diffusion; cultural evolution; democracy; language; religion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The deposit includes two distinct lithofacies. The lower sand unit is inferred to have been transported from the marine environment, with corresponding increases in the percentages of benthic marine and brackish–marine diatoms, and geochemical properties indicative of sudden changes in environmental conditions. Radiocarbon dating indicates the deposit formation is less than 402 yrs BP, and pollen indicates it is unlikely to be younger than 1870 CE. Core stratigraphy age models and co-seismic chronologies point to the marine unit most likely being emplaced by tsunami transport associated with rupture of the Wairarapa Fault in 1855 CE. The overlying unit of gravel and silt is inferred to be fluvial deposit and slope-wash from the surrounding hills, loosened by ground-shaking following the earthquake. These findings indicate the 1855 CE earthquake may have been more complex than previously thought and, or, available tsunami modelling does not fully capture the local complexities in bathymetry and topography that can cause hazardous and localized tsunami amplification in embayments like Swamp Bay.",22/06/2022,7/05/2023 4:48,7/05/2023 4:48,7/05/2023 4:48,Jan-17,,0,0,,,Tsunami or storm deposit?,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/00288306.2022.2087692,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\XATW4VJ6\King et al. - 2022 - Tsunami or storm deposit A late Holocene sediment.pdf,,,Māori; Cook Strait; D’Urville Island; earthquake; geochemistry; microfossils; Rangitoto ki te Tonga; Raukawa Moana; sedimentology; tsunami,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present a perspective on the social–ecological connections across ecosystem domains that emphasize the need for management reprioritization to effectively connect these domains. We identify critical nexus points related to the drivers of tipping points, scales of governance, and the spatial and temporal dimensions of social–ecological processes.

The method mitigates some of the known self-selection and symptom-reporting biases present in existing approaches to this type of participatory longitudinal survey data. The key novel steps in the analysis are: 1) Identifying new onset of symptoms for three different Symptom Groupings: COVID-like illness (CLI1+, CLI2+), and Influenza-like illness (ILI), for responses reported in the Flutracking survey. 2) Adjusting for symptom reporting bias by restricting the analysis to a sub-set of responses from those participants who have consistently responded for a number of weeks prior to the analysis week. 3) Weighting responses by age to adjust for self-selection bias in order to account for the under- and over- representation of different age groups amongst the survey participants. This uses the survey package [21] in R [28]. 4) Constructing 95% point-wise confidence bands for incidence estimates using weighted logistic regression from the survey package [21] in R [28]. In addition to describing these steps, the article demonstrates an application of this method to Flutracking data for the 12 months from 27th April 2020 until 25th April 2021.",1/01/2022,7/05/2023 4:41,7/05/2023 4:41,7/05/2023 4:41,101820,,,9,,MethodsX,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\HTK3MXTJ\Harvey et al. - 2022 - Calculating incidence of Influenza-like and COVID-.pdf,,,COVID-19; Flutracking; Incidence; Influenza-like illness; Logistic regression; Participatory epidemiology; Reporting bias; Survey analysis; Survey re-weighting; Syndromic surveillance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, as P2P lending has seen phenomenal growth, leading P2P lending platforms have used various market mechanisms, and in some cases, switched from one mechanism to another, chasing higher market share and overall growth. While Prosper.com, a leading P2P lending platform has switched from auction lending model to fixed price lending model, recent studies show that overall social welfare was higher with the auction lending model. However, the success of auction lending model hinges on lenders’ ability to assess the credit risk of the borrowers. Building on extant literature and in support of the auction lending model to increase the social welfare, we design an artifact to dynamically estimate borrowers’ reputation to level the playing field and improve the allocative efficiency in P2P lending markets. We posit that borrowers’ reputation built on transactional data, readily available on P2P lending platforms, represents the collective perception of lenders about the borrowers. We propose a dynamic latent class model of reputation, and use the latent instrumental variable approach to deal with endogeneity. We test our artifact using real-world P2P lending data. We show that accounting for reputation improves the explanatory power of the model, and provides a way to empirically model the evolution and impact of reputation in online platforms where repeated transactions are performed.",14/06/2020,7/05/2023 4:32,7/05/2023 4:32,7/05/2023 4:32,,,,,,,Actions Speak Louder than Words,,,,,,"Rochester, NY",en,,SSRN Scholarly Paper,,,Social Science Research Network,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\68Y7H2DE\Deng et al. - 2020 - Actions Speak Louder than Words Imputing Users’ R.pdf,,,Bayesian Analysis; Dynamic Latent Class Model; Hidden Markov Model; Latent Instrumental Variable Modeling; Peer-to-Peer Lending; Reputation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3626501,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this research, we investigate the effect of market information, generated in online auction markets, on buyers’ expectations and choices. To clear large inventories, sellers often conduct many auctions selling identical items over time, which creates an online auction market where competition dynamics spills over from one to auction to another. In these markets, bidders can participate in many auctions over a period of time, observe market information (supply, demand and competition), and gain experience to increase their payoffs. We observe that despite having an opportunity to compete and win in future auctions, many bidders stop participating in these auction markets. We argue that observed market information affects their choices. We explore how bidders form expectations about market supply, demand and competition based on information from two sources – market design parameters and behavior of market participants. By employing a hierarchical Bayesian latent attrition model, we empirically detect and investigate the effect of bidders’ expected market supply, demand and competition on their attrition in these markets. Our study shows that the effect of market information on attrition is nuanced by bidders’ value heterogeneity. Through the lenses of behavioral economics theories, we show that attrition behavior of high-value bidders is completely opposite to that of low-value bidders. We discuss practical implications of our findings.",14/06/2021,7/05/2023 4:31,7/05/2023 4:31,7/05/2023 4:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rochester, NY",en,,SSRN Scholarly Paper,,,Social Science Research Network,,,,,,,Behavioral Economics; Bidder Attrition; Expectation of Supply and Demand; Online Auction Markets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3866286,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we assess the interplay between the infodemic and specific aspects of the pandemic, such as the number of cases, the strictness of containment measures, and the news media coverage. We perform a comparative study on three countries that employed different managements of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-namely Italy, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand. We first analyze the three countries from an epidemiological perspective to characterize the impact of the pandemic and the strictness of the restrictions adopted. Then, we collect a total of 6 million posts from Facebook to describe user news consumption behaviors with respect to the reliability of such posts. Finally, we quantify the relationship between the number of posts published in each of the three countries and the number of confirmed cases, the strictness of the restrictions adopted, and the online news media coverage about the pandemic. Our results show that posts referring to reliable sources are consistently predominant in the news circulation, and that users engage more with reliable posts rather than with posts referring to questionable sources.

This reflective article reviews perspectives on rivers in Aotearoa New Zealand as wild or tamed entities. A historical overview of the socio-cultural and institutional relationships with rivers examines the meanings of rivers in Aotearoa New Zealand through multiple lenses. This includes indigenous Māori knowledge, command-and-control mentalities of a settler society that assert human authority over rivers, the emergence of the environmental movement and associated legislation with a sustainability focus (the Resource Management Act), and recent movement towards co-governance arrangements that incorporate the original intent of Te Tiriti o Waitangi (1840). It is contended that management practices have disconnected society from rivers, and vice versa, creating a sense of environmental loss (solastalgia), especially for Māori. Using rivers in the Greater Wellington Region as examples, prospects to accommodate wild river behaviour in Aotearoa New Zealand are explored.

These practices work against nature, diminishing the functionality and biodiversity values of living rivers, and associated socio-cultural relations with rivers. River confinement can accentuate flood risk by promoting development in vulnerable locations and limiting the flexibility to adapt to changing climate, prospectively accentuating future disasters. To date, uptake of space-to-move management interventions that seek to address such shortcomings is yet to happen in Aotearoa New Zealand. This is despite the fact that such practices directly align with Māori (indigenous) conceptualizations of rivers as indivisible, living entities.

The Marquesas Islands (Polynesia) are one of the world’s most remote archipelagos and illustrate the vulnerability of indigenous bioscapes to anthropogenic activities. Characterised by high levels of endemism across many biotic groups, the full spectrum of the group’s flora and fauna is nonetheless incompletely known. Several centuries of Polynesian settlement reshaped biotic communities in ways that are not yet fully understood, and historically-introduced mammalian herbivores have devastated the indigenous lowland flora. We report here on archaeological recovery of a diverse assemblage of plant and arthropod subfossils from a waterlogged deposit on the largest Marquesan island: Nuku Hiva. These materials offer new perspectives on the composition of lowland plant and arthropod communities pene-contemporaneous with human arrival. Bayesian analysis of multiple 14C results from short-lived materials date the assemblages to the mid-12th century AD (1129–1212 cal. AD, 95.4% HPD). Evidence for human activities in the catchment coincident with deposit formation includes Polynesian associated arthropods, microcharcoal, and an adzed timber. Plant macrofossils (seeds, fruits, vegetative structures) and microfossils (pollen, phytoliths) reveal coastal and lowland wet-moist forest communities unlike those observed today. Several apparently extinct taxa are identified, along with extant taxa currently constrained to high altitude and/or interior areas. A diverse inventory of subfossil arthropods—the first pre-18th century records for the islands—includes more than 100 distinct taxa, with several new archipelago records and one previously unreported for eastern Polynesia. The assemblages provide new insights into lowland Marquesan forest communities coincident with human arrival, and portend the considerable anthropogenic transformations that followed.

Nevertheless, there has been a gap between academia and industry in realizing the capabilities of simulation to support decision-making in construction. One of the well-recognized reasons is the difficulty of undertaking comprehensive simulation studies by construction practitioners, who usually lack sufficient knowledge and skills to adequately build simulation models. Efforts to bridge this gap have been focused on simplifying the computer coding and model implementation stages of construction simulation studies with limited research on the early stage of defining the model and abstracting the system, i.e., conceptual modeling. The conceptual modeling stage is known to be one of the most difficult tasks in a simulation study. Thus, several frameworks to support building conceptual models have been proposed in simulation literature. This study contributes to the research efforts to promote simulation in the construction industry through the adoption of a conceptual modeling framework. It demonstrates the application of the proposed conceptual modeling framework in a case study of piling operations. The findings of this paper reinforced the significance of conceptual modeling by confirming the role of the conceptual model as a communication link between stakeholders. Moreover, the conceptual model was used as a specification document for developing a flexible model that can be replicated in other settings. The use of a documented conceptual model assisted in managing the overall simulation study efficiently, which, in turn, lead to reductions in time and effort for different modeling activities.",1/05/2022,7/05/2023 4:01,7/05/2023 4:01,7/05/2023 4:01,433-460,,5,98,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,SAGE Journals,,Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd STM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2010 it became the second field in Kenya to be developed for energy generation, following Olkaria, which has proven to be successful and is currently undergoing expansion. In 2013 a preliminary numerical model of the Menengai field was developed  In this work a new model is developed in which supercritical conditions are imposed in the upflow region of the bottom boundary. The model is run using the University of Auckland supercritical version of the TOUGH2 simulator  Comparisons of modelled downhole temperatures with field data show that the supercritical model achieves a significantly better match than the preliminary model and that artificially low permeabilities are not required at the bottom of the model to replicate the high temperatures encountered. The possible production and reinjection scenarios investigated previously are implemented using the supercritical model and the differences discussed.",2015,22/06/2022 23:46,3/09/2022 23:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CiteSeer,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\TVFUIRFJ\O'sullivan et al. - A Supercritical Model of the Menengai Geothermal S.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\HJL4KSCT\summary.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,World Geothermal Congress,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, we have little idea of what factors influence social selection's strength. Further, social selection only contributes to overall selection when there is phenotypic assortment, but simultaneous estimates of social selection and phenotypic assortment are rare. Here, we estimated social selection on body size in a wild population of New Zealand giraffe weevils (Lasiorhynchus barbicornis). We measured phenotypic assortment by body size and tested whether social selection varied with sex ratio, density and interacted with the body size of the focal individual. Social selection was limited and unaffected by sex ratio or the size of the focal individual. However, at high densities social selection was negative for both sexes, consistent with size-based competitive interactions for access to mates. Phenotypic assortment was always close to zero, indicating negative social selection at high densities will not impede the evolution of larger body sizes. Despite its predicted importance, social selection may only influence evolutionary change in specific contexts, leaving direct selection to drive evolutionary change.",9/06/2021,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,21/06/2022 2:35,20210696,,,288,,,,,,,,Royal Society,,,,,,,royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\H55IWF5Z\Fisher et al. - 2021 - Social selection is density dependent but makes li.pdf,,,fitness; brentine; density dependent; phenotypic assortment; social selection; weevil,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All arrivals are required to spend 14 days in government-managed isolation/quarantine and to be tested for COVID-19 on day 3 and on day 12 of their stay. We model the testing, isolation and potential transmission of COVID-19 within managed isolation facilities to estimate the risk of undetected cases and the risk of infectious cases being released into the community. We use a stochastic individual-based that includes a time-dependent probability of a false negative test result, complete isolation of confirmed and probable cases, and secondary transmission of COVID-19 between close contacts. We show that the combination of 14-day quarantine with day 3 and day 12 testing reduces risk of releasing an infectious case to around 0.1% per infected arrival. Shorter quarantine periods, or reliance on testing only with no quarantine, substantially increase this risk. It is important to avoid contacts between individuals staying in quarantine to minimise the risk of secondary transmission. We calculate the ratio of cases detected on day 3 to cases detected on day 12 in the model and show that this may be a useful indicator of the likelihood of secondary transmission occurring within quarantine. We do not explicitly model transmission of COVID-19 from individuals in quarantine to staff, but this is likely to present a significant risk.

Although, the problem has largely been overcome via carefully constructed initializations and batch normalization, architectures incorporating skip-connections such as highway and resnets perform much better than standard feedforward architectures despite well-chosen initialization and batch normalization. In this paper, we identify the shattered gradients problem. Specifically, we show that the correlation between gradients in standard feedforward networks decays exponentially with depth resulting in gradients that resemble white noise whereas, in contrast, the gradients in architectures with skip-connections are far more resistant to shattering, decaying sublinearly. Detailed empirical evidence is presented in support of the analysis, on both fully-connected networks and convnets. Finally, we present a new ""looks linear"" (LL) initialization that prevents shattering, with preliminary experiments showing the new initialization allows to train very deep networks without the addition of skip-connections.",2017,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,15/06/2022 4:16,,,,,,,The Shattered Gradients Problem,,,,,arXiv,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,"arXiv:1702.08591 [cs, stat] type: article","Comment: ICML 2017, final version",C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\2CUDWDB5\Balduzzi et al. - 2018 - The Shattered Gradients Problem If resnets are th.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\NICBU3HQ\1702.html,,,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,International Conference on Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods for conducting and analysing such surveys, especially for performing automated call recognition from sound recordings, are undergoing rapid development. However, no standard metric exists to evaluate the proposed changes. Furthermore, most metrics that are currently used are specific to a single stage of the survey workflow, and therefore may not reflect the overall effects of a design choice. Here, we attempt to define and evaluate the effectiveness of surveys conducted in two common frameworks of population inference – occupancy modelling and spatially explicit capture-recapture (SCR). Specifically, we investigate precision (standard error of the final estimate) as a possible metric of survey performance, but we show that it does not lead to generally optimal designs in occupancy modelling. In contrast, precision of the SCR density estimate can be optimised with fewer experiment-specific parameters. We illustrate these issues using simulations. We further demonstrate how SCR precision can be used to evaluate design choices on a field survey of little spotted kiwi (Apteryx owenii). We show that precision correctly measures tradeoffs involving sampling effort. As a case study, we compare automated call recognition software with human annotations. The proposed metric captured the tradeoff between missed calls (8% loss of precision when using the software) and faster data through-put (60% gain), while common metrics based on per-second agreement failed to identify optimal improvements and could be inflated by deleting data. Due to the flexibility of SCR framework, the approach presented here can be applied to a wide range of different survey designs. As the precision is directly related to the power of detecting temporal trends or other effects in the subsequent inference, this metric evaluates design choices at the application level, and can capture tradeoffs that are missed by stage-specific metrics, thus enabling reliable comparison between different experimental designs and analysis methods.",2/10/2020,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,20/06/2022 5:59,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,en,"© 2020, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

In the genomics era, this debate continues, with relatedness estimates being sensitive to the methods used to generate markers, marker quality, and levels of diversity in sampled individuals. Here, we compare six commonly used genome-based relatedness estimators (kinship genetic distance (KGD), Wang Maximum Likelihood (TrioML), Queller and Goodnight (Rxy), Kinship INference for Genome-wide association studies (KING-robust), and Pairwise Relatedness (RAB), allele-sharing co-ancestry (AS)) across five species bred in captivity–including three birds and two mammals–with varying degrees of reliable pedigree data, using reduced-representation and whole genome resequencing data. Genome-based relatedness estimates varied widely across estimators, sequencing methods, and species, yet the most consistent results for known first order relationships were found using Rxy, RAB, and AS. However, AS was found to be less consistently correlated with known pedigree relatedness than either Rxy or RAB. Our combined results indicate there is not a single genome-based estimator that is ideal across different species and data types. To determine the most appropriate genome-based relatedness estimator for each new dataset, we recommend assessing the relative: (1) correlation of candidate estimators with known relationships in the pedigree and (2) precision of candidate estimators with known first-order relationships. These recommendations are broadly applicable to conservation breeding programs, particularly where genome-based estimates of relatedness can complement and complete poorly pedigreed populations. Given a growing interest in the application of wild pedigrees, our results and are also applicable to in-situ wildlife management.",12/03/2022,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,21/06/2022 4:41,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,en,"© 2022, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

These interventions were successful in containing the outbreak and ultimately eliminating community transmission of COVID-19. The timing of interventions is crucial to their success. Delaying interventions may both reduce their effectiveness and mean that they need to be maintained for a longer period. Here, we use a stochastic branching process model of COVID-19 transmission and control to simulate the epidemic trajectory in New Zealand and the effect of its interventions during its COVID-19 outbreak in March-April 2020. We use the model to calculate key measures, including the peak load on the contact tracing system, the total number of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths, and the probability of elimination within a specified time frame. We investigate the sensitivity of these measures to variations in the timing of interventions and show that changing the timing of Alert Level 4 (the strictest level of restrictions) has a far greater impact than the timing of border measures. Delaying Alert Level 4 restrictions results in considerably worse outcomes and implementing border measures alone, without Alert Level 4 restrictions, is insufficient to control the outbreak. We conclude that the rapid response in introducing stay-at-home orders was crucial in reducing the number of cases and deaths and increasing the probability of elimination.",23/10/2020,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,21/06/2022 1:57,,,,,,,,,,,,Epidemiology,,en,,preprint,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,DOI: 10.1101/2020.10.20.20216457,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\PH6SPNYT\Binny et al. - 2020 - Early intervention is the key to success in COVID-.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We find that, if age is the dominant factor determining IFR, estimated IFR for Māori is around 50% higher than non-Māori. If underlying health conditions are more important than age per se, then estimated IFR for Māori is more than 2.5 times that of New Zealand European, and estimated IFR for Pasifika is almost double that of New Zealand European. IFRs for Māori and Pasifika are likely to be increased above these estimates by racism within the healthcare system and other inequities not reflected in official data. IFR does not account for differences among ethnicities in COVID-19 incidence, which could be higher in Māori and Pasifika as a result of crowded housing and higher inter- generational contact rates. These factors should be included in future disease incidence modelling.

The continued capture, control and burial of natural water courses in Aotearoa-New Zealand is a case in point, and exemplifies a failure to stay abreast of evolving understandings and renewed relationships we seek with our waterways, our ancestors. Wai-Horotiu stream used to run down what is now Queen Street, the main road in Auckland, Aotearoa-New Zealand’s largest city. Treasured by Māori as a source of wai (water) and mahinga kai (food), it is also the home of Horotiu, a taniwha or ancestral guardian—a literal ‘freshwater body’. However, as Tāmaki-Makaurau transitioned into Auckland city, Wai-Horotiu became denigrated; used as an open sewer by early settlers before being buried alive in the colonial process. How, now, can we know this buried waterway? Te Awa Tupua Act 2017 that affords the Whanganui River juristic personality and moral considerability offers one possible solution. It acknowledges that waterways, incorporating all their physical and metaphysical elements, exist in existential interlinks with Māori as part of their whakapapa (genealogical networks). This paper asks, can a corresponding and appropriate ethics of association and care be fostered in and expressed by the political descendants of British settlers (Pākehā) and later immigrants who live here under the auspices established by Te Tiriti o Waitangi in 1840? Here is a conversation between a Māori earth systems scientist and a Pākehā interdisciplinary scholar. Where Hikuroa speaks from and to direct whakapapa connections, beginning with pepeha, Lythberg’s narrative springboards from public art projects that facilitate more ways of knowing Wai-Horotiu.

As an ethical norm, it mediates diverse interactions between individuals, groups, and organizations. It is also central to influential theories of political legitimacy, in particular the ideal of representative democracy as founded on “the consent of the governed.” Consequently, the effective exercise of consent is important for social cohesion and, therefore, resilience to shocks. Climate change is not only a source of such shocks, but it also poses challenges to the exercise of consent. The transition to a climate-resilient, low-emissions economy will be disruptive due to the scale and urgency of change required. In a society where consent has normative preeminence, the transition will inevitably produce disputes over whether consent is required by affected parties or has genuinely been given. This chapter explores the idea of consent and how it already interacts with projects and activities that both contribute to climate change and to climate mitigation and adaptation. It focuses on four applications of consent: (1) the principle of free, prior and informed consent in international human rights; (2) the government authorization of permits and consents; (3) the social license to operate for businesses; and (4) the procedures and mechanisms in democratic systems that give effect to the will of the people.

While humans build experience over multiple executions of such planning tasks and are able to recognize common patterns in different problem instances, classical optimization algorithms solve every instance independently. Machine learning (ML) can be seen as a computational counterpart to the human ability to recognize patterns based on experience. We consider variants of the classical Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem, which are based on the assumption that problem instances follow specific common patterns. For this problem, we propose a ML-based branch and price framework which explicitly utilizes those patterns. In this context, the ML models are used in two ways: (a) to predict the value of binary decision variables in the optimal solution and (b) to predict branching scores for fractional variables based on full strong branching. The prediction of decision variables is then integrated in a node selection policy, while a predicted branching score is used within a variable selection policy. These ML-based approaches for node and variable selection are integrated in a reliability-based branching algorithm that assesses their quality and allows for replacing ML approaches by other (classical) better performing approaches at the level of specific variables in each specific instance. Computational results show that our algorithms outperform benchmark branching strategies. Further, we demonstrate that our approach is robust with respect to small changes in instance sizes.",2021-09,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,20/06/2022 0:36,693-732,,3,43,,OR Spectrum,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\W7EZTDLL\Furian et al. - 2021 - A machine learning-based branch and price algorith.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Morphological, behavioural, and mitochondrial               cytochrome oxidase 1               (CO1) sequence data led a previous study to recognise the two extant populations as distinct conservation management units. Here, we further examine the genetic relationship between the extant populations using two nuclear introns (               β-fibint7               and               PAX               ). Using one mitochondrial locus (CO1), we also investigate the past distribution of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that differentiates the modern populations using bone and museum skins sourced from within its former range across New Zealand’s North and South Islands. We found significant population genetic structure between the two extant Cook’s Petrel populations for one of the two nuclear introns (               β-fibint7               ). The mitochondrial DNA CO1 analysis indicated that the SNP variant found in the Codfish Island population was formerly widely distributed across both the North and South Islands, whereas the Little Barrier Island variant was detected only in North Island samples. We argue that these combined data support the recognition of the extant populations as different subspecies. Previous names for these taxa exist, thus Cook’s Petrel from Little Barrier Island becomes               Pterodroma cookii cookii               and Cook’s Petrel from Codfish Island becomes               P. c. orientalis               . Furthermore, we suggest that both genetic and non-genetic data should be taken into consideration when planning future mainland translocations. Namely, any translocations on the South Island should be sourced from Codfish Island and future translocations on the North Island should continue to be sourced from Little Barrier Island only.",2021-03,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,20/06/2022 0:36,Jan-13,,1,31,,Bird Conservation International,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we use fifteen years of linked employer-employee data to examine different explanations for this gender wage gap. We find an overall gender wage gap between 20% and 28%, of which gender differences in sorting across occupations explain 9%, across industries 16% to 19%, and across firms 5% to 9%, respectively. The remaining within-firm gender wage gap is still between 13% and 17%. Around 5 percentage points of this are explained by women being less willing to bargain or less successful at bargaining to capture firm-specific rents. Gender differences in productivity also explain at most 4.5 percentage points of this remaining gap. These results suggest that taste discrimination is also important for explaining why women are paid less than their relative contribution to firm output.

LFLI484X,book,2021,,Indigenous data sovereignty and policy,,978-0-367-22236-9,,,,"""Around the world Indigenous peoples remain largely alienated from the collection, use and application of the data about them, their lands, and their cultures. This book investigates this problem, demonstrating how it disenfranchises Indigenous peoples from shaping policy to meet their needs. The book looks both at how policy is developed and implemented by a nation state in relation to its Indigenous peoples, and at how Indigenous nations develop policy related to their own peoples. Overall the book aims to elucidate the problems and challenges of the Indigenous data and Indigenous policy connection and address these across socio-cultural spheres, across Indigenous nations and across nation states. Arguments for both the problematics and remediating strategies of data and policy interactions are framed through the central concept of Indigenous data sovereignty, which asserts the rights of Indigenous peoples to own, control, access and possess data that derive from them, and which pertain to their members, knowledge systems, customs or territories. Bringing together the work of the work of more than 20, primarily Indigenous, scholars from seven nation states (Australia, United States, Canada, Aotearoa New Zealand, Mexico, Sweden and Spain), this book will be of considerable interest to researchers of Indigenous Studies across the world""--",2021,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,,,,,,,,Routledge studies in indigenous peoples and policy,,,,Routledge,"Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY",,,,,,Library of Congress ISBN,GN380 .I3456 2021,,"Indigenous data sovereignty, governance and the link to indigenous policy / Maggie Walter and Stephanie Russo Carroll -- ""Pushing the space"" : data sovereignty and self-determination in Aotearoa NZ / Tahu Kukutai and Donna Cormack -- The intersection of indigenous data sovereignty and closing the gap policy in Australia / Raymond Lovett, Roxanne Jones and Bobby Maher -- Growing Pueblo data sovereignty / Michele Suina and Carnell T.

Unlike in existing studies (Ellis in Theoretical Economics 11:865–895, 2016; Fabrizi et al., in: AUT Economics Working Paper, 2021; Ryan in Theory and Decision 90:543–577, 2021), the locus of ambiguity is the likelihood function (signal precision) rather than the prior. This significantly alters the properties of symmetric equilibria. While prior ambiguity may induce multiple equilibria (Fabrizi et al., in: AUT Economics Working Paper, 2021; Ryan in Theory and Decision 90:543–577, 2021) we show that, under likelihood ambiguity, there exists a unique non-trivial symmetric responsive equilibrium that takes the same form as in the absence of ambiguity (Feddersen and Pesendorfer in The American Political Science Review 92:23–35, 1998). Moreover, likelihood ambiguity partially offsets the pernicious effects of pivotality on decision quality: the frequency of Type I error (convicting the innocent) is typically lower than in the absence of ambiguity.",2022,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,17/06/2022 6:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rochester, NY",en,,SSRN Scholarly Paper,,,Social Science Research Network,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\RZMIZRAH\papers.html,,,Ambiguity; Belief updating; Pivotality; Voting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4045152,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The shapes, either described as continuous curves or surfaces or parameterized as a set of landmark points or an image, can be deformed one to another using smooth invertible functions with smooth inverse (diffeomorphisms). The set of diffeomorphisms is an infinite-dimensional manifold and also a group. We can interpret the variability of shapes by the nature of the deformations applied to them, allowing the shapes to be treated as elements of a highly nonlinear Riemannian manifold. In this chapter we introduce the concept of geometric shape analysis, emphasizing the underlying geometric picture and how it relates to a variety of different ways to describe shapes. We describe the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework for shape deformation and show how the shape spaces inherit the geometry of the diffeomorphism group. For the common cases of landmarks and images, we describe the geodesic equations in explicit form.

(Tāwhiao 1894)‘A doorway opened wide to the bounty of foods, to the multitudes of people.’In 1884, the Kīngitanga (Māori King Movement) instituted its first punakai (uniting of food sources) to feed its people. At that time the country was ravaged by warfare, which rendered access to prime food and water scarce to followers of the Kīngitanga. King Tāwhiao, the second Māori King, established the punakai to feed the widowed, the orphaned, and the destitute, and all who mourned the loss of loved ones in the war. Later re-named poukai, this institution continues to this day.  A series of annual gatherings take place at Kīngitanga marae, the gathering places of the extended family who belong to that place, and who are responsible for each poukai. Marae pool their food resources to host the Māori King and his family, and to feed the people. The poukai is now an institution in itself with food at its very centre. We provide examples of traditional pre-European foods, as well as foods introduced after the arrival of Europeans in New Zealand. We discuss the relationships between the poukai, food and identity, and identify some of the issues that poukai marae face, as well as events and trends that have impacted and caused change. In Māori culture, mana recognises the reciprocal relationships between people, and between people and place, asserting that each has a responsibility to each other. Control over resources, and provision of traditional foods at events such as the poukai, is essential to the mana of Māori.  We discuss the cultural value that marae place on their kai and how these cultural values are impacted by change. Finally, we comment on the sustainability of these poukai, and how the poukai connect to a continuing vision of revitalisation and self-determination for Tainui.",12/12/2019,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,17/06/2022 1:18,,,,,,,Reciprocal relationships,,,,,SocArXiv,,,,preprint,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,DOI: 10.31235/osf.io/tz746,,"C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\WEAVQJ4U\Wehi and Roa - 2019 - Reciprocal relationships identity, tradition and .pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Air temperature is an important baseline parameter for terrestrial Antarctica in the context of patterns and processes in climatology, hydrology or ecology. There are still large uncertainties on how the Antarctic system responds to spatio-temporal variability of temperature. This can partly be attributed to the lack of high resolution datasets. In this paper, we present AntAir, a new dataset of gridded air temperatures in 1 km spatial and daily temporal resolution that is available since 2003. AntAir was created by modelling daily air temperature from MODIS land surface temperature using machine learning algorithms. Data from 70 weather stations was used as a reference. Daily temperatures could be estimated with a R2 of 0.91 and a RMSE of 5.07 °C validated on independent years. The performance to estimate the time series of a new spatial location was R2 = 0.78 and RMSE = 5.83 °C. Hence the high spatial and temporal resolution of the dataset as well as the high accuracy make AntAir an important baseline dataset for a wide range of applications in environmental science of Antarctica. The dataset is available at https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.902166 (daily, Meyer et al., 2019a) and https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.902193 (monthly, Meyer et al., 2019b).",16/12/2019,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,17/06/2022 1:18,,,,,,,AntAir,,,,,"Data, Algorithms, and Models",,,,preprint,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,DOI: 10.5194/essd-2019-215,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\EA8DKDNE\Meyer et al. - 2019 - AntAir satellite-derived 1 km daily Antarctic air.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the case of interactions between institutions engaging in collaboration for technological innovation, the underlying network is bipartite with institutions (agents) linked to the patents they have filed (artefacts), while the projection is the co-patenting network. Since projected network properties are highly affected by the underlying bipartite structure a lack of understanding of the bipartite network has consequences for the information that might be drawn from the one-mode co-patenting network. Here, we create an empirical bipartite network using data from 2.7 million patents recorded by the European Patent Office. We project this network onto the agents (institutions) and look at properties of both the bipartite and projected networks that may play a role in knowledge sharing and collaboration. We compare these empirical properties to those of synthetic bipartite networks and their projections. We show that understanding the bipartite network topology is critical for understanding the potential flow of technological knowledge. Properties of the bipartite structure, such as degree distributions and small cycles, affect the topology of the one-mode projected network—specifically degree and clustering distributions, and degree assortativity. We propose new network-based metrics as a way to quantify how collaborative agents are in the collaboration network. We find that several large corporations are the most collaborative agents in the network; however, such organizations tend to have a low diversity of collaborators. In contrast, the most prolific institutions tend to collaborate relatively little but with a diverse set of collaborators. This indicates that they concentrate the knowledge of their core technical research while seeking specific complementary knowledge via collaboration with smaller institutions.",9/10/2020,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,20/06/2022 0:36,cnaa016,,4,8,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\UYCGPAVC\1909.html; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\GFS3FWEP\Filho and O’Neale - 2020 - The role of bipartite structure in R&D collaborati.pdf,,,,"Latapy, Matthieu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initiative, which builds on existing prevention activities, aims to strengthen the health prevention system through evidence-driven action to enable people to make good food choices, be physically active, smoke-free and free from alcohol-related harm. Key investment areas are a dedicated systems thinking and acting health promotion workforce, and activating leaders who can influence transformational change. The evaluation to date has found the initiative is being implemented with integrity. Evidence indicates a shift towards greater action on prevention, and the prevention system being strengthened. Māori ownership has been enabled, and prioritizing equity has led teams to utilize methods that amplify diverse local perspectives. There is progress on developing a flexible workforce through adaptive learning, flexible resources, professional development and a responsive National team. There is also progress in activating local leadership and empowering local teams. The initiative design has explicitly taken into account the context of complexity within which it is being implemented. It has evolved to focus on action that can accelerate sharing information and practices within communities, and between policy and decision-makers.

The following hypotheses were tested: (i) mat expansion will reflect cover increases at the reach scale; (ii) biomass and cover will be highest in high-velocity habitats; and (iii) under similar velocities, nutrient concentrations will be more important than other abiotic and biotic variables in determining expansion rates. Mat expansion accurately reflected the increase in reach-scale cover, and expansion was most rapid at intermediate water velocities (0.25–0.45 m·s               –1               ).

However, it has not gained widespread adoption within the industry. A considerable effort to increase the acceptance of DES in construction has been carried out. However, it has been heavily focused on implementing DES models, neglecting both a detailed conceptualization of the real system and an understanding of stakeholders' requirements. Conceptual modeling (CM) is a fundamental step in DES which helps build stakeholders' trust in the resulting model. We argue, then, that it is vital to develop a CM framework for the construction domain to improve the acceptance of DES in the industry. We propose a domain-specific CM framework for construction application. This framework will be formulated to suit the complex environment of construction projects.",2017-12,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,2372-2383,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,ISSN: 1558-4305,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\GQWWEEJ8\8247967.html,,,Stakeholders,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I7EGJFPF,report,2016,"McDonald, Nicola; McDonald, Garry; Harvey, Emily",Dynamic Economic Model: Economics of Resilient Infrastructure Programme Research Report 2017/02,,,,,,"The Economics of Resilient Infrastructure (ERI) programme is a four-year research programme funded by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. An important output of this programme is the development of a new analytical tool that will enable researchers and stakeholders to quantify the economic impacts of infrastructure failure, and evaluate the consequences of post-disaster recovery strategies. The research team has named the economic tool ‘MERIT’ (Modelling the Economics of Resilient Infrastructure Tool). The Dynamic Economic Model (referred to often in this report simply as ‘the model’) is a multisectoral and multi-regional dynamic economic model that constitutes a principal component of MERIT. The model has been intentionally designed to imitate the core features of a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. CGE models tend to be the favoured approach and ‘state-of-art’ in the modelling of regional- and national-level economic impacts. Among the advantages of these types of models are the whole-of-economy coverage, the capture of not only indirect (i.e. the so-called upstream and downstream multiplier effects generated through supply chains) and induced (i.e. as generated through household consumption) economic consequences, but also of the ‘general equilibrium’ (pricing) impacts. While the model incorporates core features of a CGE model, it is important to note that it differs from a ‘standard’ CGE model in that it is a System Dynamics model formulated using differential equations that describe how the elements in the system change with time. This is an innovative extension to economic modelling undertaken in part to improve our ability to capture the impacts of infrastructure outages that push a system away from equilibrium. It is also worth noting that building an economic model such as described in this report is an important, but not sufficient step required to evaluate the economic consequences of system shocks, such as road or other infrastructure outage. Also included within MERIT is the Business Behaviours Module (Brown et al. 2015), developed using empirical data gathered following the 2010/2011 Canterbury Earthquakes. It seeks to describe the effect of disruptions on an organisation’s operability or ability to meet demand. The development of plausible and useful disruption scenarios, including costing the impact of transport outages, is also another significant part of the process of modelling economic disruption scenarios. Once information is transformed into appropriate inputs and the model run, the Dynamic Economic Model is able to produce a variety of indicators to help us evaluate the impacts in aggregate and by industry of an infrastructure outage, including Gross Domestic Product (GDP), regional Value Added (similar to a regional equivalent of GDP), value of exports and imports, and household utility. It is worthwhile noting that the latter indicator is conceptually consistent with measurements that are sought to be calculated in a cost-benefit analysis. The model thus has the potential to be used for cost-benefit analysis as well as economic impact analysis.",1/11/2016,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,,,,,,,Dynamic Economic Model,,,,,Market Economics,,,,Technical Report,,,ResearchGate,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\VX6UI34V\McDonald et al. - 2016 - Dynamic Economic Model Economics of Resilient Inf.pdf; ,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320972498_Dynamic_Economic_Model_Economics_of_Resilient_Infrastructure_Programme_Research_Report_201702,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He focussed on voting under majority rule and the implications of ambiguity for Condorcet’s Theorem. Ryan (2021) studied Ellis’s game when voting takes place under the unanimity rule. His focus was on the implications of ambiguity for the “jury paradox” (Feddersen and Pesendorfer, 1998). Neither paper described all equilibria of these games, though both authors identified equilibria with a very different structure to those in the respective games without ambiguity. We complete the description of all equilibria of voting games under the unanimity rule.

All else being equal, theory predicts that the more distinct the niches of such co-occurring and competing species, the more species that can persist in the long run. However, both theoretical and experimental studies define a priori the nature and number of resources over which species compete. It therefore remains unclear whether or not species in empirically realistic contexts are actually exploiting all or some of the niches available to them. Here we provide a mathematical solution to this long-standing problem. Specifically, we show how to use the interactions between sets of co-occurring plant species to quantify their implied “niche dimensionality”: the effective number of resources over which those species appear to be competing. We then apply this approach to quantify the niche dimensionality of 12 plant assemblages distributed across the globe. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we found that the niche dimensionality in these systems was much lower than the number of competing species. However, two high-resolution experiments also show that changes in the local environment induce a reshuffling of plant’s competitive roles and hence act to increase the assemblages’ effective niche dimensionality. Our results therefore indicate that homogeneous environments are unlikely to be able to maintain high diversity and also shows how environmental variation impacts species’ niches and hence their opportunities for long-term survival.",12/11/2021,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,21/06/2022 6:35,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,en,"© 2021, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

ANS, a measure of weak sustainability, represents changes in a country's capital stock including financial, physical, human and natural capital. We show that an increase in strong sustainability, measured by EF and by ANS's natural capital component, is associated with reductions in SWB over the next decade followed by a rebound in SWB over the subsequent decade. We show also that the perfect substitutability assumptions on which ANS is calculated do not hold. Our findings highlight an important political challenge: governments that run sustainable policies may decrease the near-term wellbeing of citizens.

Here we provide context for understanding the scholarship landscape in Aotearoa, including how scholarships are understood in relation to dominant neoliberal framings of higher education and persistent inequities within the sector. We present data which provides insight into the current inequities in Summer, Masters and PhD scholarship values. The average value of PhD scholarships has remained stagnant between 2011 and 2019 resulting in the average being $11,238 less than the Living Wage in 2019. We show that the average length of time full-time PhD students take to complete their doctorates exceeds the three-year tenure of scholarships. We argue the status-quo of low scholarships, supplemented by postgraduate ‘sweat’, excludes people from participating in postgraduate education, preventing them and their communities from realising the public benefits that such an education can produce. We suggest that these inadequacies could be addressed through 1) raising Summer, Masters and PhD scholarships to the living wage; 2) extending tenure of PhD scholarships; and 3) reinstating the postgraduate student allowance.",25/11/2021,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,21/06/2022 6:16,,,,,,,Sweat Equity,,,,,SocArXiv,,en-us,,,,,OSF Preprints,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\TIJPFUQE\Soar et al. - 2021 - Sweat Equity Student scholarships in Aotearoa New.pdf,,,New Zealand; Disability and Equity in Education; Education; Higher Education; inequity; PhD; postgraduate study; scholarships; stipends,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that rapid vaccine updates to target new strains are more effective than slow updates and containing spread through non-pharmaceutical interventions is vital whilst these vaccines are delivered.

In this paper, we first summarise the evidence on the effects of involuntary job loss on displaced workers’ wellbeing. We conclude that displacement harms workers’ mental health and economic security in the short term and negatively affects their earnings and mortality risk in the long term. We then extrapolate the estimates of Hyslop and Townsend (2017) to estimate the economy-wide net-present value of wages lost as a result of displacement by the workers displaced in New Zealand in a representative year. Our estimates suggest that this value is likely between $3.3 billion (in a year of economic upswing) and $15.4 billion (in a year of very severe economic downswing). Finally, we survey the policy options available for dealing with involuntary displacement. We conclude that unemployment insurance or unemployment benefits can effectively mitigate the immediate negative effects of displacement and have only small downsides. By contrast, training and job placement programs are typically ineffective, but in some circumstances might have high potential upside.",2021,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,21/06/2022 5:30,,,,,,,Involuntary job loss,,,,,Motu,,en,,Working Paper,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,DOI 10.2139/ssrn.3937734,,"C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\JCBPSNUM\Hyslop et al. - 2021 - Involuntary job loss welfare effects, earnings im.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, the study of shapes is an important part of many scientific fields such as evolutionary biology, structural biology, image processing, and archaeology. The most widely-used method of shape analysis, Geometric Morphometrics, assumes that that the mathematical space in which shapes are represented is linear. However, it has long been known that shape space is, in fact, rather more complicated, and certainly non-linear. Diffeomorphic methods that take this non-linearity into account, and so give more accurate estimates of the distances among shapes, exist but have rarely been applied to real-world problems. Using a machine classifier, we tested the ability of several of these methods to describe and classify the shapes of a variety of organic and man-made objects. We find that one method, the Square-Root Velocity Function (SRVF), is superior to all others, including a standard Geometric Morphometric method (eigenshapes). We also show that computational shape classifiers outperform human experts, and that the SRVF shortest-path between shapes can be used to estimate the shapes of intermediate steps in evolutionary series. Diffeomorphic shape analysis methods, we conclude, now provide practical and effective solutions to many shape description and classification problems in the natural and human sciences.",27/08/2021,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,21/06/2022 5:10,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,"Number: arXiv:2109.00920 arXiv:2109.00920 [cs, stat]","Comment: 7 pages, 6 figures",C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\L878M6YW\Salili-James et al. - 2021 - Classifying Organisms and Artefacts By Their Shape.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\92IYHM3G\2109.html,,,62P99; Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Statistics - Methodology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv:2109.00920,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spatial variability arises from gradients in topographic, edaphic, and geologic landscape attributes that govern the four dominant processes (atmospheric, hydrological, microbially mediated redox, physical and chemical weathering) that generate, store, attenuate, and transport contaminants. This manuscript extends the application of Process Attribute Mapping (PoAM), a hydrochemically guided landscape classification system for modelling spatial variation in multiple water quality indices, using New Zealand (268,021 km²) as an example. Twelve geospatial datasets and >10,000 ground and surface water samples from 2,921 monitoring sites guided the development of 16 process-attribute gradients (PAG) within a geographic information system. Hydrochemical tracers were used to test the ability of PAG to replicate each dominant process (cross validated R² of 0.96 to 0.54). For water quality, land use intensity was incorporated and the performance of PAGwasevaluated using an independent dataset of 811 long-term surface water quality monitoring sites (R² values for total nitrogen of 0.90 -0.71 (median = 0.78), nitrate-nitrite nitrogen 0.83 -0.71 (0.79), total phosphorus 0.85 -0.63 (0.73), dissolved reactive phosphorus 0.76 -0.57 (0.73), turbidity 0.92 -0.48 (0.69), clarity 0.89 -0.50 (0.62) and E. coli 0.75 -0.59 (0.74)). The PAGs retain significant regional variation, with relative sensitivities related to variable geological and climatic histories.

Method The study was a qualitative study design guided by systemic intervention methodology. Qualitative data were collected through key informant interviews (n=63) and focus group discussions (n= 12), and case study-based thematic analysis was carried out. Causal loop diagram was utilised to illustrate the dynamic interactions of the social determinants based on the themes. The study also involved sense-making sessions with policy level and local stakeholders. Findings Four key interacting themes emerged from the study. Dietary and physical activity practices have shifted significantly at community level contributing to increased risk of NCDs. The practice of healthy and locally produced meals was gradually being displaced by junk food and linked to junk food availability and declining agricultural activities. Health system was ineffective in preventing unhealthy practices. Gender and social economic factors were driving the poor dietary practices and physical inactivity. Conclusion While the current dietary and physical activity-related practices within communities were poor, the broader determinants such as socio-economic circumstances and gender further fuelled such practices.

The “cooperative phenotype” is a stable psychological preference for cooperating in social dilemmas that involve a tension between individual and collective interest. Since climate change poses a social dilemma on a global scale, this issue may evoke similar psychological processes as smaller social dilemmas. Here, we investigate the relationships between the cooperative phenotype and climate change belief and behaviour with a representative sample of New Zealanders (n = 897). By linking behaviour in a suite of economic games to self-reported climate attitudes, we show robust positive associations between the cooperative phenotype and both climate change belief and pro-environmental behaviour. Furthermore, our mediation analyses support a motivated reasoning model in which the relationship between the cooperative phenotype and pro-environmental behaviour is fully mediated by climate change belief. These findings suggest that common psychological mechanisms underlie cooperation in both micro-scale social dilemmas and larger-scale social dilemmas like climate change.",25/07/2021,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,21/06/2022 4:58,,,,,,,,,,,,PsyArXiv,,en-us,,,,,OSF Preprints,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\KYSRFJS2\Kelly et al. - 2021 - Cooperative phenotype predicts climate change beli.pdf,,,cooperation; climate change belief; Environmental Psychology; motivated reasoning; pro-environmental behaviour; Prosocial Behavior; Social and Behavioral Sciences; Social and Personality Psychology; Social Cognition; Sustainability Behavior,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neutralising antibodies (Nabs) are increasingly being recognised as a correlate of protection and whilst there are many studies which follow the response of a cohort of people, each study alone is not enough to predict the long term response. Studies use different assays to measure Nabs making them hard to combine. We present a modelling method which can combine multiple datasets and can be updated as more detailed data becomes available.

We focus on two issues. First, to examine the selectivity of the CWS, we describe the characteristics of firms and of workers who did and did-not receive subsidy payments. Second, to gauge how the pandemic and the CWS affected the labour market, we describe two aspects of the adjustment process: the job-turnover rates for workers in subsidised and non-subsidised firms; and trends in the transition rates between non-employed in subsidised and non-subsidised employment. We find that there was a larger drop in job turnover rates in subsidised than non-subsidised firms, but the excess turnover in subsidised firms had return to pre-lockdown levels by September, while that in non-subsidised firms remained low.",2021,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,21/06/2022 3:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Motu,,en,,Working Paper,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,10.2139/ssrn.3547767,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\3KD9A2VW\Maré and Hyslop - 2021 - COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Support and Effects.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21-Feb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We consider a range of scenarios to address this question, all beginning from an initial, infected case in the community when only minimal (Alert Level 1) controls are in place. We simulate with a network-based contagion model until the ﬁrst infected case is detected, after which we trigger one of a range of possible interventions and continue the simulation. Each of these interventions is a combination of multiple control measures. We represent these control measures as context-speciﬁc transmission reductions, varying across home, workplace/school, and community contexts. We allow transmission routes via both ‘close’ and ‘casual’ contacts within each infection context, each with speciﬁc intervention-dependent reductions in transmission rate. The precise effects of these interventions on the individual-level, context-dependent transmission rates are challenging to determine a priori. Thus, though given in terms of percentage reductions relative to baseline, these are primarily set qualitatively and intended as representative only. This analysis also serves as a sensitivity study for the dependence of our model on these transmission parameters.",2021,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,,18,,,,,,,,,,,Te Pūnaha Matatini,,en,,Technical Report,,,Zotero,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\PDQQFK93\Harvey et al. - Contagion Network Modelling of Effectiveness for a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A reflexive thematic analysis leads us to identify three key themes: 1) open, honest and straightforward communication; 2) distinctive and motivational language; and 3) expressions of care.

In 2019, we ran a Rōpū Whai Whakaaro/Values-Based Practice course in Auckland with 21 community participants. As part of the five-week course, six women aged from 31 to 65 years did a group project on the value of kindness. Analysis of their discussions, presentation and individual interviews suggested a kindness ‘trajectory’ that was simultaneously held in community and undercut by social forces. Kindness was described as something people ‘do’ beginning with children who are ‘innately’ kind, and if practised regularly could flow in all directions. It was portrayed as having radical potential to include and transform, but participants spoke of themselves as imperfect practitioners.

To study C storage dynamics due to long-term (1952–2009) phosphorus (P) fertilizer and irrigation treatments in New Zealand grasslands, we measured radiocarbon (               14               C) in archived soil along with observed changes in C stocks to constrain a compartmental soil model. Productivity increases from P application and irrigation in these trials resulted in very similar C accumulation rates between 1959 and 2009. The ∆               14               C changes over the same time period were similar in plots that were both irrigated and fertilized, and only differed in a non-irrigated fertilized plot. Model results indicated that decomposition rates of fast cycling C (0.1 to 0.2 year               −1               ) increased to nearly offset increases in inputs. With increasing P fertilization, decomposition rates also increased in the slow pool (0.005 to 0.008 year               −1               ). Our findings show sustained, significant (i.e. greater than 4 per mille) increases in C stocks regardless of treatment or inputs. As the majority of fresh inputs remain in the soil for less than 10 years, these long term increases reflect dynamics of the slow pool. Additionally, frequent irrigation was associated with reduced stocks and increased decomposition of fresh plant material. Rates of C gain and decay highlight trade-offs between productivity, nutrient availability, and soil C sequestration as a climate change mitigation strategy.",2021-10,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,21/06/2022 2:12,145-160,,1,156,,Biogeochemistry,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\EJWZSYJA\Stoner et al. - 2021 - Soil organic matter turnover rates increase to mat.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This research contributes to threshold values on NZ’s food waste and seeks to understand the impact of the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown on household food waste in NZ. The data presented here form part of the ‘Covid Kai Survey’, an online questionnaire that assessed cooking and food planning behaviours during the 2020 lockdown and retrospectively before lockdown. Of the 3028 respondents, 62.5% threw out food ‘never’/‘rarely’ before lockdown, and this number increased to 79.0% during lockdown. Participants who wasted food less frequently during lockdown were more likely to be older, work less than full-time, and have no children. During lockdown, 30% and 29% of those who ‘frequently’ or ‘sometimes’ struggled to have money for food threw out food ‘sometimes or more’; compared with 20% of those who rarely struggled to have money for food (p < 0.001). We found that lower levels of food waste correlated with higher levels of cooking confidence (p < 0.001), perceived time (p < 0.001), and meal planning behaviours (p < 0.001).

With limited healthcare and challenging living conditions, people living in poverty may be particularly susceptible to endemic and emerging diseases. Similarly, wildlife is impacted by human influences, including pathogen sharing, especially for species in close contact with people and domesticated animals. Here we investigate human and animal contacts and human health in a community living around the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP), Uganda. We used contact and health survey data to identify opportunities for cross-species pathogen transmission, focusing mostly on people and the endangered mountain gorilla. We conducted a survey with background questions and self-reported diaries to investigate 100 participants’ health, such as symptoms and behaviours, and contact patterns, including direct contacts and sightings over a week. Contacts were revealed through networks, including humans, domestic, peri-domestic, and wild animal groups for 1) contacts seen in the week of background questionnaire completion, and 2) contacts seen during the diary week. Participants frequently felt unwell during the study, reporting from one to 10 disease symptoms at different intensity levels, with severe symptoms comprising 6.4% of the diary records and tiredness and headaches the most common symptoms. After human-human contacts, direct contact with livestock and peri-domestic animals were the most common. The contact networks were moderately connected and revealed a preference in contacts within the same taxon and within their taxa groups. Sightings of wildlife were much more common than touching. However, despite contact with wildlife being the rarest of all contact types, one direct contact with a gorilla with a timeline including concerning participant health symptoms was reported. When considering all interaction types, gorillas mostly exhibited intra-species contact, but were found to interact with five other species, including people and domestic animals. Our findings reveal a local human population with recurrent symptoms of illness in a location with intense exposure to factors that can increase pathogen transmission, such as direct contact with domestic and wild animals and proximity among animal species. Despite significant biases and study limitations, the information generated here can guide future studies, such as models for disease spread and One Health interventions.",24/11/2021,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,21/06/2022 2:12,e0254467,,11,16,,PLoS ONE,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\LT26VKIH\Muylaert et al. - 2021 - Community health and human-animal contacts on the .pdf,,,,"Fèvre, Eric",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the incidence and natural drivers of antimicrobial resistance and pathogenic virulence in the environment, including waterways and ground water, are poorly understood. Freshwater monitoring for microbial pollution relies on culturing bacterial species indicative of faecal pollution, but detection of genes linked to antimicrobial resistance and/or those linked to virulence is a potentially superior alternative. We collected water and sediment samples in the autumn and spring from three rivers in Canterbury, New Zealand; sites were above and below reaches draining intensive dairy farming. Samples were tested for loci associated with the AMR-related group 1 CTX-M enzyme production (               bla               CTX-M               ) and Shiga toxin producing               Escherichia coli               (STEC).

Both countries require overseas arrivals to quarantine in government-managed facilities at the border. In both countries, community outbreaks of COVID-19 have been started via infection of a border worker. This workforce is rightly being prioritized for vaccination. However, although vaccines are highly effective in preventing disease, their effectiveness in preventing infection with and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is less certain. There is a danger that vaccination could prevent symptoms of COVID-19 but not prevent transmission. Here, we use a stochastic model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and testing to investigate the effect that vaccination of border workers has on the risk of an outbreak in an unvaccinated community. We simulate the model starting with a single infected border worker and measure the number of people who are infected before the first case is detected by testing. We show that if a vaccine reduces transmission by 50%, vaccination of border workers increases the risk of a major outbreak from around 7% per seed case to around 9% per seed case. The lower the vaccine effectiveness against transmission, the higher the risk. The increase in risk as a result of vaccination can be mitigated by increasing the frequency of routine testing for high-exposure vaccinated groups.",2021-09,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,21/06/2022 2:12,210686,,9,8,,R.

Further, by ignoring more complex joint effects of nearby SNPs within a given region, these methods fail to consider the genomic context of an association with the outcome.                                         Results               To address these shortcomings, we present a more powerful method for GWAS, coined ‘Wavelet Screening’ (WS), that greatly reduces the number of tests to be performed. This is achieved through the use of a sliding-window approach based on wavelets to sequentially screen the entire genome for associations. Wavelets are oscillatory functions that are useful for analyzing the local frequency and time behavior of signals. The signals can then be divided into different scale components and analyzed separately. In the current setting, we consider a sequence of SNPs as a genetic signal, and for each screened region, we transform the genetic signal into the wavelet space. The null and alternative hypotheses are modeled using the posterior distribution of the wavelet coefficients. WS is enhanced by using additional information from the regression coefficients and by taking advantage of the pyramidal structure of wavelets. When faced with more complex genetic signals than single-SNP associations, we show via simulations that WS provides a substantial gain in power compared to both the traditional GWAS modeling and another popular regional association test called SNP-set (Sequence) Kernel Association Test (SKAT). To demonstrate feasibility, we applied WS to a large Norwegian cohort (N=8006) with genotypes and information available on gestational duration.                                         Conclusions               WS is a powerful and versatile approach to analyzing whole-genome data and lends itself easily to investigating various omics data types. Given its broader focus on the genomic context of an association, WS may provide additional insight into trait etiology by revealing genes and loci that might have been missed by previous efforts.",2021-12,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,21/06/2022 2:12,484,,1,22,,BMC Bioinformatics,Wavelet Screening,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\BNNFPVA8\Denault et al. - 2021 - Wavelet Screening a novel approach to analyzing G.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plant transpiration links physiological responses of vegetation to water supply and demand with hydrological, energy, and carbon budgets at the land–atmosphere interface. However, despite being the main land evaporative flux at the global scale, transpiration and its response to environmental drivers are currently not well constrained by observations. Here we introduce the first global compilation of whole-plant transpiration data from sap flow measurements (SAPFLUXNET, https://sapfluxnet.creaf.cat/, last access: 8 June 2021). We harmonized and quality-controlled individual datasets supplied by contributors worldwide in a semi-automatic data workflow implemented in the R programming language. Datasets include sub-daily time series of sap flow and hydrometeorological drivers for one or more growing seasons, as well as metadata on the stand characteristics, plant attributes, and technical details of the measurements. SAPFLUXNET contains 202 globally distributed datasets with sap flow time series for 2714 plants, mostly trees, of 174 species. SAPFLUXNET has a broad bioclimatic coverage, with woodland/shrubland and temperate forest biomes especially well represented (80 % of the datasets). The measurements cover a wide variety of stand structural characteristics and plant sizes. The datasets encompass the period between 1995 and 2018, with 50 % of the datasets being at least 3 years long. Accompanying radiation and vapour pressure deficit data are available for most of the datasets, while on-site soil water content is available for 56 % of the datasets. Many datasets contain data for species that make up 90 % or more of the total stand basal area, allowing the estimation of stand transpiration in diverse ecological settings. SAPFLUXNET adds to existing plant trait datasets, ecosystem flux networks, and remote sensing products to help increase our understanding of plant water use, plant responses to drought, and ecohydrological processes. SAPFLUXNET version 0.1.5 is freely available from the Zenodo repository (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3971689; Poyatos et al., 2020a).

These responses can inform our forecasts of future biotic responses to similar perturbations. However, previous analyses of ancient food webs rarely accounted for key differences between modern and ancient community data, particularly selective loss of soft-bodied taxa during fossilization. To consider how fossilization impacts inferences of ancient community structure, we (1) analyzed node-level attributes to identify correlations between ecological roles and fossilization potential and (2) applied selective information loss procedures to food web data for extant systems. We found that selective loss of soft-bodied organisms has predictable effects on the trophic structure of “artificially fossilized” food webs because these organisms occupy unique, consistent food web positions. Fossilized food webs misleadingly appear less stable (i.e., more prone to trophic cascades), with less predation and an overrepresentation of generalist consumers. We also found that ecological differences between soft- and hard-bodied taxa—indicated by distinct positions in modern food webs—are recorded in an early Eocene web, but not in Cambrian webs. This suggests that ecological differences between the groups have existed for ≥48 Myr. Our results indicate that accounting for soft-bodied taxa is vital for accurate depictions of ancient food webs. However, the consistency of information loss trends across the analyzed food webs means it is possible to predict how the selective loss of soft-bodied taxa affects food web metrics, which can permit better modeling of ancient communities.",2021-08,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,21/06/2022 2:12,385-401,,3,47,,Paleobiology,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\VAULXFQX\Shaw et al. - 2021 - Disentangling ecological and taphonomic signals in.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extensive contract tracing during the outbreak has resulted in a dataset of epidemiologically linked cases. This data contains useful information about the transmission dynamics of the virus, its dependence on factors such as age, and its response to different control measures. We use Monte-Carlo network construction techniques to provide an estimate of the number of secondary cases for every individual infected during the outbreak. We then apply standard statistical techniques to quantify differences between groups of individuals. Children under 10 years old are significantly under-represented in the case data. Children infected fewer people on average and had a lower probability of transmitting the disease in comparison to adults and the elderly. Imported cases infected fewer people on average and also had a lower probability of transmitting than domestically acquired cases. Superspreading is a significant contributor to the epidemic dynamics, with 20% of cases among adults responsible for 65–85% of transmission. Subclinical cases infected fewer individuals than clinical cases. After controlling for outliers serial intervals were approximated with a normal distribution (               μ               = 4.4 days,               σ               = 4.7 days).

We model the testing, isolation and transmission of COVID-19 within quarantine facilities to estimate the risk of community outbreaks being seeded at the border. We use a simple branching process model for COVID-19 transmission that includes a time-dependent probability of a false-negative test result. We show that the combination of 14-day quarantine with two tests is highly effective in preventing an infectious case entering the community, provided there is no transmission within quarantine facilities. Shorter quarantine periods, or reliance on testing only with no quarantine, substantially increases the risk of an infectious case being released. We calculate the fraction of cases detected in the second week of their two-week stay and show that this may be a useful indicator of the likelihood of transmission occurring within quarantine facilities. Frontline staff working at the border risk exposure to infected individuals and this has the potential to lead to a community outbreak.

Given how specialized a topic invertebrate biology is, a large part of its communication fall to scientists. Here, we surveyed both scientists and members of the public about the former’s approaches and assumptions and the latter’s interest and expectations regarding invertebrate science communication, confronting the results of each survey.

We construct a bipartite network—based on revealed comparative advantage—linking geographic regions with areas of technology and compare its properties to those of artificial networks using a series of randomization strategies, to uncover the patterns of regional diversity and technological ubiquity. Our results show that the technological outputs of regions create nested patterns similar to those of ecological networks. These patterns suggest that regions need to dominate various technologies first (those allegedly less sophisticated), creating a diverse knowledge base, before subsequently developing less ubiquitous (and perhaps more sophisticated) technologies as a consequence of complementary knowledge that facilitates innovation. Finally, we create a map—the Patent Space Network—showing the interactions between technologies according to their regional presence.

Automatic lidars and ceilometers (ALCs) provide valuable information on cloud and aerosols but have not been systematically used in the evaluation of general circulation models (GCMs) and numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Obstacles associated with the diversity of instruments, a lack of standardisation of data products and open processing tools mean that the value of large ALC networks worldwide is not being realised. We discuss a tool, called the Automatic Lidar and Ceilometer Framework (ALCF), that overcomes these problems and also includes a ground-based lidar simulator, which calculates the radiative transfer of laser radiation and allows one-to-one comparison with models. Our ground-based lidar simulator is based on the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) Observation Simulator Package (COSP), which has been extensively used for spaceborne lidar intercomparisons. The ALCF implements all steps needed to transform and calibrate raw ALC data and create simulated attenuated volume backscattering coefficient profiles for one-to-one comparison and complete statistical analysis of clouds. The framework supports multiple common commercial ALCs (Vaisala CL31, CL51, Lufft CHM 15k and Droplet Measurement Technologies MiniMPL), reanalyses (JRA-55, ERA5 and MERRA-2) and models (the Unified Model and AMPS – the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System). To demonstrate its capabilities, we present case studies evaluating cloud in the supported reanalyses and models using CL31, CL51, CHM 15k and MiniMPL observations at three sites in New Zealand. We show that the reanalyses and models generally underestimate cloud fraction. If sufficiently high-temporal-resolution model output is available (better than 6-hourly), a direct comparison of individual clouds is also possible. We demonstrate that the ALCF can be used as a generic evaluation tool to examine cloud occurrence and cloud properties in reanalyses, NWP models, and GCMs, potentially utilising the large amounts of ALC data already available. This tool is likely to be particularly useful for the analysis and improvement of low-level cloud simulations which are not well monitored from space. This has previously been identified as a critical deficiency in contemporary models, limiting the accuracy of weather forecasts and future climate projections. While the current focus of the framework is on clouds, support for aerosol in the lidar simulator is planned in the future.",6/01/2021,22/06/2022 23:46,22/06/2022 23:46,21/06/2022 1:57,43-72,,1,14,,Geosci.

By accessing individual-level microdata from New Zealand’s Integrated Data Infrastructure, we are able to create a co-enrolment network comprised of all STEM assessment standards taken by students in New Zealand between 2010 and 2016. We explore the structure of this co-enrolment network though use of community detection and a novel measure of entropy. We then investigate how network structure differs across sub-populations based on students’ sex, ethnicity, and the socio-economic-status (SES) of the high school they attended. Results show the structure of the STEM co-enrolment network differs across these sub-populations, and also changes over time. We find that, while female students were more likely to have been enrolled in life science standards, they were less well represented in physics, calculus, and vocational (e.g., agriculture, practical technology) standards. Our results also show that the enrollment patterns of Asian students had lower entropy, an observation that may be explained by increased enrolments in key science and mathematics standards. Through further investigation of differences in entropy across ethnic group and high school SES, we find that ethnic group differences in entropy are moderated by high school SES, such that sub-populations at higher SES schools had lower entropy.

These outbreaks originated at the border; via isolating returnees, airline workers, and cargo vessels. With a public health system informed by real-time viral genomic sequencing which typically had complete genomes within 12 hours after a community-based positive COVID-19 test, every outbreak was well-contained with a total of 225 community cases, resulting in three deaths. Real-time genomics were essential for establishing links between cases when epidemiological data could not, and for identifying when concurrent outbreaks had different origins.

We propose a tripartite model that recognises not only citizens and scientists, but also an important third role, which we call the ‘enabler’. In doing so, we acknowledge that additional expertise and skillsets are often present in citizen science projects, but are frequently overlooked in associated literature. We interrogate this model by applying it to three case studies and explore how the success and sustainability of a citizen science project requires all roles to be acknowledged and interacting appropriately. In this era of ‘wicked problems’, the nature of science and science communication has become more complex. In order to address critical emerging issues, a greater number of stakeholders are engaging in multi-party partnerships and research is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary. Within this context, explicitly acknowledging the role and motivations of everyone involved can provide a framework for enhanced project transparency, delivery, evaluation and impact.

We employed a range of robust phylodynamic methods and genome subsampling strategies to infer the epidemiological history of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in these four countries. We compared these results to transmission clusters identified by the New Zealand Ministry of Health by contact tracing strategies. We estimated the effective reproduction number of COVID-19 as 1–1.4 during early stages of the pandemic and show that it declined below 1 as human movement was restricted. We also showed that this disease was introduced many times into each country and that introductions slowed down markedly following the reduction of international travel in mid-March 2020.

We present a method for leveraging UAV-acquired lidar data with data collected using different lidar platforms (terrestrial and piloted aircraft), at a range of resolutions (1 to +1,000 points per m               2               ) and geographic scales. We use these instruments to document a dry-masonry stone wall enclosing a religious precinct within the royal center at Kealakekua, Kona District, Hawai'i Island. Prior to European contact in AD 1779, Kealakekua was the center of the island-wide polity during the annual Makahiki festival. Results of this study suggest that when the wall was constructed around AD 1640, it was the largest structure ever built on the island of Hawai'i as well as a strong material expression of the power of state religion and the Makahiki rituals.                        ,              Mientras que la tecnología lidar se convierte en una práctica regular en la prospección arqueológica, tanto sus aplicaciones terrestres como las aéreas pueden ser complementadas con tecnología lidar integrada en drones o en inglés “unpiloted aerial vehicle” (UAV).

Such surveys often require automatic detection of target sound events in the large amount of data produced. However, current processing methods, especially those relying on sound intensity for detection, are severely impacted by wind, which causes transient intensity peaks. The rapid dynamics of this noise invalidate standard noise estimators, and no satisfactory method for dealing with wind exists in bioacoustics, where simple training and generalization between conditions are important. We estimate the transient noise level by fitting short-term spectrum models to a wavelet packet representation. This estimator is then combined with log-spectral subtraction to stabilize the background level. The resulting adjusted wavelet series can be analysed by standard detectors. We use real data from long-term acoustic monitoring to tune this workflow, demonstrate its denoising capabilities and test the improved detection in two population surveys of birds. The proposed short-term estimator was more effective than standard (constant) noise estimates in both denoising and detection tasks. In the surveys, the noise-robust workflow greatly reduced the number of false alarms. As a result, the survey efficiency (precision of the estimated call density) improved for both species. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed estimator can adjust for transient broadband noises without requiring additional hardware or extensive tuning to each species. It improved the detection workflow based on very little training data, making it particularly attractive for detection of rare species or general soundscape analysis.",2022,27/05/2023 3:10,27/05/2023 3:10,27/05/2023 3:10,2005-2017,,9,13,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/2041-210X.13928,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\5WY2C6WQ\Juodakis and Marsland - 2022 - Wind-robust sound event detection and denoising fo.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\BT8TP9AG\2041-210X.html,,,bioacoustics; denoising; passive acoustic monitoring; sound event detection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We apply the model to a bifurcated population of university staff—those with high research activity, and those who are moderately active—based on their national research quality score. We then test levers in various combinations that management could pull to improve gender representation. We find that the solutions are different for the high versus moderate research performers.

Because metawebs are typically expressed at large spatial and taxonomic scales, assembling them is a tedious and costly process; predictive methods can help circumvent the limitations in data deficiencies, by providing a first approximation of metawebs. One way to improve our ability to predict metawebs is to maximize available information by using graph embeddings, as opposed to an exhaustive list of species interactions. Graph embedding is an emerging field in machine learning that holds great potential for ecological problems. Here, we outline how the challenges associated with inferring metawebs line-up with the advantages of graph embeddings; followed by a discussion as to how the choice of the species pool has consequences on the reconstructed network, specifically as to the role of human-made (or arbitrarily assigned) boundaries and how these my influence ecological hypotheses.",19/02/2022,10/05/2023 2:32,15/05/2023 0:13,10/05/2023 2:32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,CC-BY Attribution-No Derivatives 4.0 International,,,,ecoevorxiv.org,,Publisher: EcoEvoRxiv,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\X8PMNRKD\Strydom et al. - 2022 - Graph embedding and transfer learning can help pre.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, climate change will alter rainfall patterns, increase the incidence and severity of extreme events, and gradually increase temperatures which will all modify terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems. Our comprehensive review of reported climate change impacts in New Zealand indicates that most measured impacts to date are due to indirect impacts (such as exacerbation of invasive species impacts) and most are in the marine realm. Ocean acidification and marine heatwaves are particularly problematic for calcareous organisms and algae respectively. Other notable impacts include thermal squeeze in the alpine zone and impacts of drought on freshwater fish. Very small populations of rare and threatened species can be very vulnerable to extreme events (e.g. fire, floods). While the evidence for climate change impacts is sparse in some regions and for some ecosystems, we encourage ongoing monitoring to identify processes of decline that may need to be mitigated.

In particular, initiatives driven by Māori are building upon relational understandings of rivers as entities that are more ancient and powerful than people, viewing water and rivers as the lifeblood of society and the land with lives and rights of their own. Within these relational ways of knowing and being, a river—or another body of water—can simultaneously be an ancient kin, a revered elder, and a living entity.

A key strand of the government approach is Te Mana o te Wai—The Charisma of Water, a national korowai (cloak) that frames and informs the trajectory for immediate and future policy development and regional freshwater planning. This concept encompasses the integrated and holistic health and wellbeing of waters as a continuum from the mountains to the sea.

Solutions to this problem consider surgery durations and allocate elective surgeries to OR sessions in order to create surgical lists of high quality. Determining the quality of a surgical list is a key undertaking within OR scheduling and is the focus of this research. Currently, probability- and/or expectation-based measures of surgical lists are used instead of statistical distributions of surgery lists to measure quality. The use of multiple measures, e.g., a combination of expectation and probability to assess a surgical list, complicates OR scheduling, so we introduce a new single measure – the OR scheduling metric – for evaluating surgical lists before their realisations, i.e., for use within OR scheduling. We apply the OR scheduling metric to an actual elective dataset and use simulation to demonstrate its use, including customised scheduling rules. We recommend the adoption of a benchmarked OR scheduling metric by the elective surgical services in hospitals with expected practical benefits in the long run, i.e., simpler OR scheduling and more desirable room utilisation, to be similar to that observed in our simulations.",29/09/2022,7/05/2023 7:57,12/05/2023 1:11,7/05/2023 7:57,,,,,,Oper Manag Res,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\CJ2LRB9N\Soh et al. - 2022 - Innovative operating room scheduling metric for cr.pdf,,,Simulation; Benchmarking; Performance measure; Surgery scheduling; Surgical list; Utilisation rate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To help understand the scope of the soil degradation in Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ), what the public values about soil, and the public's concerns about soil, Soilsafe Aotearoa was launched. It provides ongoing free heavy metals testing for households and undertook a survey on community values of soil (with adults participants). Yet, nearly a quarter of NZ's population is under 15 years old. To include children's voices, Soilsafe Kids was launched this year as the educational and outreach branch of Soilsafe Aotearoa. Our flagship program (the ""Three Day Programme"") is comprised of eight workshops spread over three days that showcase interdisciplinary and multicultural lessons spanning from mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge) about soil's importance to the relationship between soil and fiber to soil's pH. Throughout the program, students participate in research by completing surveys in the form of worksheets, focus groups disguised as group discussions, and art projects to reveal values. The penultimate workshop focuses on science communication and contains substantial time to co-create an output that can be shared with parents, the school community, or on Soilsafe Aotearoa's web presence. The Three Day Programme is unique not only because of its interdisciplinary and combined research-outreach nature but also because of who is involved, how it was developed, and how the results are being disseminated. This program brings together scientists from universities and government agencies, local school charities, and artists with students from historically underrepresented minorities and rural schools. It is designed for students who are early readers who are familiar with school routines but may not see themselves as leaders in their communities yet. After our data collection ends, preliminary results will be shared with participants, their families, and their schools in an online webinar. Final results will not only be disseminated to the academic community and stakeholders but also to the public in the form of art exhibits across our region. In this presentation, we share our initial learnings about engaging with these populations who have less access to outreach and the development of the transdisciplinary Soilsafe Kids program.",1/12/2022,10/05/2023 8:42,10/05/2023 23:23,10/05/2023 8:42,ED32B-0540,,,2022,,,Soilsafe Kids,,,,,American Geophysical Union,"Chicago, IL",,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2022AGUFMED32B0540T,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On a regular basis, successive trials occur, in each of which an automatic measurement of a quantum superposition inside the apparatus either causes instant death or does nothing to the observer. From the observer's perspective, the chances of surviving $m$ trials monotonically decreases with increasing $m$. As a result, if the observer is still alive for sufficiently large $m$ she must reject any interpretation of quantum mechanics which is not the many-worlds interpretation (MWI), since surviving $m$ trials becomes vanishingly unlikely in a single world, whereas a version of the observer will necessarily survive in the branching MWI universe. Here we ask whether this conclusion still holds if rather than a classical understanding of limits built on classical logic we instead require our physics to satisfy a computability requirement by investigating the Everett Box in a model of a computational universe running on a variety of constructive logic, Recursive Constructive Mathematics. We show that although the standard Everett argument rejecting non-MWI interpretations is no longer valid, we can show that Everett's conclusion still holds within a computable universe. Thus we argue that Everett's argument is strengthened and any counter-argument must be strengthened, since it holds not only in classical logic (with embedded notions of continuity and infinity) but also in a computable logic.",24/03/2022,10/05/2023 23:02,10/05/2023 23:02,10/05/2023 23:02,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,"arXiv:2007.09847 [physics, physics:quant-ph]",Comment: 14 pages,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\L9FUMUEM\Wilson - 2022 - Quantum Immortality and Non-Classical Logic.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\5L8XSC9Z\2007.html,,,Mathematics - History and Overview; Physics - History and Philosophy of Physics; Quantum Physics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv:2007.09847,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent evolutionary theories suggest that cultural selection may favour moralising stories that motivate prosocial behaviours. A key challenge is to explain the emergence of mythologies that lack explicit moral exemplars or directives. Here, we resolve this puzzle with an evolutionary model in which arbitrary mythologies transform a collection of egoistic individuals into a cooperative. We show how these otherwise puzzling amoral, nonsensical, and fictional narratives act as exquisitely functional coordination devices and facilitate the emergence of trust and cooperativeness in both large and small populations.

Theory predicts that beta-diversity is a consequence of two factors, species-level differences (defined as the variations among species in the probabilities that species are present in the landscape) and spatial heterogeneity (defined as the difference, between two sites, in the probabilities with which species are present). At present, however, the importance of each factor is unclear. Here, we take a probabilistic and combinatorial approach to examine the effects of species differences and spatial heterogeneity on the degree to which species assemblages in two spatial locations differ in species compositions. We first derived analytical and approximation formulae of the expectation and variance of the pairwise beta-diversity, based on the assumption that the presence probabilities of species are independent of each other. Though it seems intuitive that greater species differences leads to greater beta-diversity, our methods predict that the reverse is likely to occur under some circumstances; strikingly, when space is homogeneous, beta-diversity decreases with increasing species differences. This prediction suggests that policy making for increasing species traits-variation would, without adequately managing environmental heterogeneity, induce biotic homogeneization, resulting in undesired outcomes. Second, we illustrate our method using data from five woodpecker species in Switzerland, showing that the woodpecker species’ joint distributions change considerably with time, and also that such changes are basically explained by the changes in the incidences of some of the species. The new framework can improve our understanding of how pairwise beta-diversity responds to species differences and spatial heterogeneity.",2022,10/05/2023 4:52,10/05/2023 4:52,10/05/2023 4:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Europe PMC,,DOI: 10.1101/2022.12.13.520233 Type: article,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\ISRHMX46\Iritani et al. - 2022 - Jaccard dissimilarity in stochastic community mode.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, since nations are connected in various ways, such as via spatial proximity and shared cultural ancestry, cross-national analyses often violate assumptions of non-independence, inflating false positive rates. Here, we show that, despite being recognised as an important statistical pitfall for over 200 years, cross-national research in economics and psychology still does not sufficiently account for non-independence. In a review of the 100 highest-cited cross-national studies of economic development and values, we find that controls for non-independence are rare. When studies do include controls for non-independence, our simulations suggest that commonly used methods continue to produce false positives. In reanalyses of twelve cross-national relationships, we show that half are no longer significant after controlling for non-independence using global proximity matrices.

We have developed SALSA 2D in a GLM/GAM regression framework but this paper shows the flexibility of this approach by applying it to presence only data and use a downweighted Poisson regression. Using SALSA2D for model selection provided a more realistic local/clustered intensity surface compared with the model average approach. The full analysis results showed high carcass intensity close to water holes and roads and in areas of the park with average rainfall. Some high risk areas were identified and these revelations are important for effective park management, particularly mitigation of poaching.

However, among other factors, the variability of patient acuity levels and corresponding treatment requirements of patients visiting EDs imposes significant challenges on decision makers. Balancing waiting times of patients to be first seen by a physician with the overall length of stay over all acuity levels is crucial to maintain an acceptable level of operational performance for all patients. To address those requirements when assigning idle resources to patients, several methods have been proposed in the past, including the Accumulated Priority Queuing (APQ) method. The APQ method linearly assigns priority scores to patients with respect to their time in the system and acuity level. Hence, selection decisions are based on a simple system representation that is used as an input for a selection function. This paper investigates the potential of an Machine Learning (ML) based patient selection method. It assumes that for a large set of training data, including a multitude of different system states, (near) optimal assignments can be computed by a (heuristic) optimizer, with respect to a chosen performance metric, and aims to imitate such optimal behavior when applied to new situations. Thereby, it incorporates a comprehensive state representation of the system and a complex non-linear selection function. The motivation for the proposed approach is that high quality selection decisions may depend on a variety of factors describing the current state of the ED, not limited to waiting times, which can be captured and utilized by the ML model. Results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the APQ method for a majority of evaluated settings",8/06/2022,10/05/2023 2:24,10/05/2023 2:24,10/05/2023 2:24,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,"arXiv:2206.03752 [cs, math]",,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\LNE67II6\Furian et al. - 2022 - Machine learning-based patient selection in an eme.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\VA3U9QMC\2206.html,,,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Mathematics - Optimization and Control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv:2206.03752,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All citizen science research programs need to balance often conflicting expectations and imperatives of the researchers and the participants. This paper assesses VegeSafe and DustSafe participant and researcher outcomes against common goals of citizen science programs, including participant engagement, accessibility, motivations and learning in order to evaluate the programs’ impact and usefulness. Questionnaire data from 522 questionnaires were analysed which showed that VegeSafe and DustSafe have: enhanced participants’ involvement in science (76%), understanding of science (62%); addressed specific community concerns (91%); and were considered useful (93%). The success of the VegeSafe and DustSafe programs can be measured by the number of samples received, households engaged and its geographic footprint across Australia's most populated cities. The participant questionnaire provided deeper insight into positive participant outcomes, including participant autonomy in the scientific process and changes in attitudes and behaviours towards science. Many participants adopted interventions to mitigate potential toxic trace metal exposure in their domestic spaces after receiving their results.

While the science of nanotechnology is indicated to offer improvements to conventional vineyard inputs and operations, its acceptability by potential users and consumers has an impact on the governance of nano-enabled agriculture. This governance takes place not just at the state level through regulation and policy, but also through corporate, and community sectors' use of branding and narratives about nanotechnology and nano-based agrichemicals, and the (non)consumption of nano-enabled products. This paper investigates the technical and market acceptability, or governance, of nanotechnology by elucidating the attitudes of industry gatekeepers towards wines grown with nanotechnology. This necessarily informs the 'market permissibility' of such technologies, and illuminates sensitivities, concerns, and consumer-based barriers to adoption. We conducted 15 semi-structured, key informant interviews and a thematic data analysis. Our results suggest a high level of technical acceptability, particularly if environmental sustainability benefits are made clear. Wine producers are interested in nano-solutions to labour, pest and disease, and cost of production issues. However, key actors in the production-consumption network of New Zealand wine have concerns about nano-enabled approaches. Regulatory approval and safety assurances are expected prior to adoption in food or wine. Respondents argue that consumer acceptability is less clear, and that thought leaders like wine writers, intermediaries and 'influencers' will be critical in shaping public opinion.

The number of studies employing playback is growing larger every year because it is easy to apply, increasingly affordable and very effective. However, the way that it is used and reported varies significantly across researchers and species. This lack of a protocol for reporting acoustic playbacks inevitably slows the progress of the field, as studies cannot be easily compared. In 1991, some of the most knowledgeable researchers in the field of animal communication met at a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Advanced Research Workshop (ARW) at Thornbridge Hall in the UK to consider the design of playback experiments. The proceedings of the meeting were published in 1992 and contain crucial guidelines regarding this use of playback. In this paper we review the literature for papers published since that milestone that use acoustic playback in ornithological fieldwork contexts. We use the RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses (ROSES) to evaluate the description of the methods used. The main goal of this review paper is to identify a shared set of rules for employing and reporting the playback technique in such contexts to promote reproducibility and comparability. We found 625 peer-reviewed articles in three on-line databases, of which 419 reported field (rather than captive) studies employing avian playback. The biggest hindrance to reproducibility is the availability of the acoustic tracks used by authors; 4% (15 articles) of our sample made their tracks publicly available. We found that only one article provided enough details for their playback application to be fully reproducible. Further, only five articles (0.92%) provided enough information for reproducibility, even if we assume information about track preparation and recording details to be unnecessary when tracks are available. Based on our synthesis of the literature, we provide a set of recommendations for the reporting of playback uses to promote reproducibility, including sample paragraphs of description as supplementary material. We strongly recommend that tracks used for such experiments are deposited in dedicated on-line repositories for the use of other researchers. While our focus is avian fieldwork applications of the playback technique, we believe that our findings can be easily transferred to other animal systems subject to acoustic playback.",2022,22/06/2022 23:46,7/05/2023 9:10,7/05/2023 4:29,371-387,,2,164,,,The acoustic playback technique in avian fieldwork contexts,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ibi.13033,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\G6HJ4ND4\De Rosa et al. - 2022 - The acoustic playback technique in avian fieldwork.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\HRSJ3VG9\ibi.html,,,bioacoustics; bird; method; ornithology; reproducibility,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is not yet understood whether niche packing is facilitated by higher specialization and reduced niche overlap or, rather, by diffuse competition and increased niche overlap. We combined highly resolved bird-plant interaction networks, bird phylogenies, and plant functional traits to compare dietary niche overlap and foraging frequencies among frugivorous birds at seven sites in the tropical Andes. We quantified niche overlap on the basis of the traits of the plants used by each bird and related it to the degree of niche packing at the different sites. Niche complementarity decreased with increasing niche packing, suggesting that increasingly dense niche packing is facilitated by increased niche overlap. Pairwise niche overlap was mediated by shifts in foraging frequencies away from shared resources, and it decreased with decreasing phylogenetic relatedness and increasing dependence on fruit as resource. Our findings suggest that foraging choices are a key axis of diversification in frugivorous birds and that differences in resource use frequencies are already sufficient to reduce potential competition between ecologically similar species and facilitate niche packing, especially if species differ in their dependence on particular resources.",2022-06,22/06/2022 23:46,7/05/2023 9:09,21/06/2022 5:54,855-868,,6,199,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon),,Publisher: The University of Chicago Press,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35580221,,Animals; Diet; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Birds; Eltonian foraging niche; Feeding Behavior; Fruit; interspecific competition; mutualism; niche evolution; niche overlap; Phylogeny; seed dispersal interaction networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The “cooperative phenotype” is a stable psychological preference for cooperating in social dilemmas that involve a tension between individual and collective interest. Since climate change poses a social dilemma on a global scale, this issue may evoke similar psychological processes as smaller social dilemmas. Here, we investigate the relationships between the cooperative phenotype and climate change belief and behaviour with a representative sample of New Zealanders (N = 897). By linking behaviour in a suite of economic games to self-reported climate attitudes, we show robust positive associations between the cooperative phenotype and both climate change belief and pro-environmental behaviour. Furthermore, our structural equation models support a motivated reasoning account in which the relationship between the cooperative phenotype and pro-environmental behaviour is mediated by climate change belief.

The manner in which such corporations mitigate many types of reputational risk and negative media coverage is therefore considered, particularly during periods of economic contraction and negative consumer sentiment. Specifically, this research sets out to establish whether the presence of recession influences investor response to negative media releases and broad reputationally damaging events focused upon financial institutions. Results indicate the existence of significant dynamic interactions of both returns and abnormal returns when comparing expansionary and contractionary economic conditions. The most severe, broadest reaching, and directly related news releases are found to generate even more depressed, persistent differentials of stock market response. Such results shed light on a slow-paced time evolution as to the restoration of semi-strong market efficiency during extreme negative information shocks, which are heterogeneously pronounced during the recession, thereby creating additional incentive for financial institutions to delay, or shroud the release of damaging information until economic conditions better facilitate a more forgiving investor response.",27/09/2022,7/05/2023 4:10,7/05/2023 8:34,7/05/2023 4:10,,,,,,,Another Iceberg Ahead,,,,,,,en,,,,,Social Science Research Network,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\IC7DZ6YF\Akyildirim et al. - 2022 - Another Iceberg Ahead Are Corporate Reputational .pdf,,,Sentiment; Corporate Reputation; Investor Behaviour; Market Misconduct; Recession.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The article begins with the position that gender equity in academia in Aotearoa New Zealand and beyond is well known yet little engaged with. The recent Sector Reference Group (SRG) set up to engage with the TEC and the academic community about the PBRF Quality Evaluation 2025 has articulated the most progressive agenda yet for women and Māori and Pacific scholars specifically. The article takes a forensic approach, inspired by Sara Ahmed, to follow gender around in the discursive environment within which the PBRF is placed. The article first provides a brief contextual setting for gender representation in the university. The article then explores the sustained critique of the PBRF, paying particular attention to the work of Brower and James (2019) and Walker et al. (2020) and their examination of the gender disparities evident in academia. The article continues by exploring recent SRG reports of the PBRF and the subsequently announced changes to the PBRF. It is argued that these changes move to realign the PBRF so that it accommodates a series of demands made of it in recent years that coalesce around a thicker social justice agenda. Finally, the extent to which women’s inequality in academia will ever be a significant issue, despite the changes to the PBRF, that drives equity change is questioned.",2022,7/05/2023 4:55,7/05/2023 8:30,7/05/2023 4:55,52-67,,2,10,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,www.ceeol.com,,Publisher: Addleton Academic Publishers,,,,,Aotearoa New Zealand; gender equity; gender representation; PBRF; research management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this act of reciprocal exchange entails the risk of the other agent defecting with both goods. We examine the choreography for safe exchange between strangers, and identify the minimum requirement, which is a shared hold, either of an object, or the other party; we show that competing agents will settle on exchange as a local optimum in the space of payoffs. Truly safe exchanges are rarely seen in practice, even though unsafe exchange could mean that risk-averse agents might avoid such interactions. We show that an ‘implicit’ hold, whereby an actor believes that they could establish a hold if the other agent looked to be defecting, is sufficient to enable the simple swaps that are the hallmark of human interactions and presumably provide an acceptable trade-off between risk and convenience.

Changes in beta diversity over time are thought to be due to selection based on species’ niche characteristics. For example, theory predicts that selection that favours habitat specialists will increase beta diversity. In practice, ecologists struggle to predict how beta diversity changes. To remedy this problem, we propose a novel solution that formally measures selection’s effects on beta diversity. Using the Price equation, we show how change in beta diversity over time can be partitioned into fundamental mechanisms including selection among species, variable selection among communities, drift, and immigration. A key finding of our approach is that a species’ short-term impact on beta diversity cannot be predicted using information on its long-term environmental requirements (i.e. its niche). We illustrate how our approach can be used to partition causes of diversity change in a montane tropical forest before and after an intense hurricane. Previous work in this system highlighted the resistance of habitat specialists and the recruitment of light-demanding species but was unable to quantify the importance of these effects on beta diversity. Using our approach, we show that changes in beta diversity were consistent with ecological drift. We use these results to highlight the opportunities presented by a synthesis of beta diversity and formal models of selection.",6/07/2021,7/05/2023 8:24,7/05/2023 8:24,7/05/2023 8:24,,,,,,,,,,,,Ecology,,en,,preprint,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,DOI: 10.1101/2021.07.05.451214,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\SSJ3AJJG\Godsoe et al. - 2021 - Disentangling niche theory and beta diversity chan.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much of that diversity is bound up in the social practices of Indigenous groups, which is why these practices have great long-term value. Yet, little attention has been given to them by philosophers. Also neglected have been the historical conditions and contemporary realities that constrain these practices and devalue the knowledge of their practitioners. In this essay, we make the case for preserving a diverse range of social practices worldwide, and we argue that this is possible only by strengthening the communities of practitioners who enact them in the contexts in which they are adaptive. By concentrating on Indigenous communities, we show how focusing on practices can transform how Indigenous and other local communities are represented in global climate-change conversations and policy as a matter of justice.

This allowed time for vaccination rates to increase and the roll out of third doses of the vaccine (boosters) to begin. It also meant more data on the characteristics of Omicron became available prior to the first cases of community transmission. Here we present a mathematical model of an Omicron epidemic, incorporating the effects of the booster roll out and waning of vaccine-induced immunity, and based on estimates of vaccine effectiveness and disease severity from international data. The model considers differing levels of immunity against infection, severe illness and death, and ignores waning of infection-induced immunity. This model was used to provide an assessment of the potential impact of an Omicron wave in the New Zealand population, which helped inform government preparedness and response. At the time the modelling was carried out, the date of introduction of Omicron into the New Zealand community was unknown. We therefore simulated outbreaks with different start dates, as well as investigating different levels of booster uptake. We found that an outbreak starting on 1 February or 1 March led to a lower health burden than an outbreak starting on 1 January because of increased booster coverage, particularly in older age groups. We also found that outbreaks starting later in the year led to worse health outcomes than an outbreak starting on 1 March. This is because waning immunity in older groups started to outweigh the increased protection from higher booster coverage in younger groups. For an outbreak starting on 1 February and with high booster uptake, the number of occupied hospital beds in the model peaked between 800 and 3,300 depending on assumed transmission rates. We conclude that combining an accelerated booster programme with public health measures to flatten the curve are key to avoid overwhelming the healthcare system.",1/06/2022,7/05/2023 8:12,7/05/2023 8:12,7/05/2023 8:12,94-105,,2,7,,Infectious Disease Modelling,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\EHGP3FHY\Vattiato et al. - 2022 - An assessment of the potential impact of the Omicr.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\TLGIX76V\S2468042722000215.html,,,COVID-19; Public health; Epidemiological modelling; Immunity; Infectious diseases; Vaccination,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In doing so, this paper examines how Māori and other Indigenous peoples might continue to work towards equitable participation in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. Given the complex nature of the Antarctic region, our analysis focusses on case studies in similarly complex multijurisdictional areas, in the Arctic, and across the Murray Darling Basin in Australia. Working towards equitable participation in each of these cases has been supported by the collectivisation of Indigenous voices, use and establishment of strong Indigenous organisational structures, consistent influence on environmental law and policy, articulation of Indigenous policy, and alignment of Indigenous knowledges and worldviews with the environmental objectives of the regions.

The main purpose of this study is to provide a basis for policy advice on border restrictions and control measures in response to outbreaks that may occur during the vaccination roll-out. The model can be used to estimate the theoretical population immunity threshold, which represents a point in the vaccine rollout at which border restrictions and other controls could be removed and only small, occasional outbreaks would take place. We find that, with a basic reproduction number of 6, approximately representing the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, and under baseline vaccine effectiveness assumptions, reaching the population immunity threshold would require close to 100% of the total population to be vaccinated. Since this coverage is not likely to be achievable in practice, relaxing controls completely would risk serious health impacts. However, the higher vaccine coverage is, the more collective protection the population has against adverse health outcomes from COVID-19, and the easier it will become to control outbreaks. There remains considerable uncertainty in model outputs, in part because of the potential for the evolution of new variants.

While trust-building mechanisms such as seller feedback systems can mitigate these problems, they are based on past transactions and other users’ experiences. They provide useful information about a transaction only after it is completed, and have only indirect effects on buyers’ trust in sellers because they are not based on direct interactions between a trustor (buyer) and a trustee (seller). On the other hand, direct engagement between transacting parties during an online auction, particularly open and public engagement, can have a direct effect on buyers’ trust, thereby reducing information asymmetry between buyers and sellers. In this paper, we analyze how public buyer-seller engagement via Q&A (question and answer) during online auctions impacts bidding behavior. We analyze auction data from a large auction platform that supports public Q&A between buyers and sellers and show that the seller’s engagement with buyers during an auction can significantly impact the behavior of both, buyers who ask questions as well as lurkers who passively observe the engagement (spillover effect). Our analysis also shows that the impact of the seller’s engagement depends on features such as product type and seller reputation. A key insight from our study is that the impact of seller engagement on bidding behavior is moderated by seller feedback ratings, which indicates that trust-building mechanisms in online markets interact in their effects on buyers’ decision-making. As sellers gain positive (negative) feedback, the impact of buyer-seller engagement on bidding behavior increases (decreases); furthermore, the cost of an additional negative feedback rating outweighs the benefit of a positive one. Overall, this study provides valuable insights for online auction platforms and their stakeholders.",6/01/2022,7/05/2023 8:05,7/05/2023 8:05,7/05/2023 8:05,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rochester, NY",en,,SSRN Scholarly Paper,,,Social Science Research Network,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\YKR7GP9Q\Tripathi et al. - 2022 - Analyzing the Impact of Public Buyer-Seller Engage.pdf,,,Fixed-effects estimation; Online Auction; public Q&A; Seller engagement; Seller reputation; Trust-building,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4002035,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this reason, large parts of the world have a data deficit when it comes to species interactions and how the resulting networks are structured. As data collection alone is unlikely to be sufficient, community ecologists must adopt predictive methods. We present a methodological framework that uses graph embedding and transfer learning to assemble a predicted list of trophic interactions of a species pool for which their interactions are unknown. Specifically, we ‘learn’ the information (latent traits) of species from a known interaction network and infer the latent traits of another species pool for which we have no a priori interaction data based on their phylogenetic relatedness to species from the known network. The latent traits can then be used to predict interactions and construct an interaction network. Here we assembled a metaweb for Canadian mammals derived from interactions in the European food web, despite only 4% of common species being shared between the two locations. The results of the predictive model are compared against databases of recorded pairwise interactions, showing that we correctly recover 91% of known interactions. The framework itself is robust even when the known network is incomplete or contains spurious interactions making it an ideal candidate as a tool for filling gaps when it comes to species interactions.

It remains unclear how effectively these WSTs can reduce crop yield loss, crop yield variation, and the loss of net crop income caused by water scarcity. Therefore, this paper aimed to analyze the role of WSTs in response to drought by establishing a multi-objective expected utility function based on 988 farmers across the Huang-Huai-Hai region. Econometric analysis employing an endogenous switching regression model showed that using WSTs can significantly reduce crop yield loss and net income loss caused by drought.

In this research, we explored the views of healthcare professionals in the UK on the countrywide management of organ donation and transplantation during the first COVID-19 surge in the spring of 2020. Methods: An internet-based survey was developed and distributed over a 2-week period in May/June 2020. Results: Three hundred and fourteen professionals responded, covering all organ donation and transplant regions across the UK. Data suggest a considerable degree of scaling back of activity in all but one region (Northern Ireland). A range of absolute criteria for organ donation and transplantation were highlighted that have since been implemented in practice. Notable strengths of the countrywide response included the donation and transplant community acting responsibly and proportionately (51.6%), providing access to up-to-date information and data (43.9%,) and communicating risk (40.8%). Mixed views were expressed on equity in resource allocation, with 32% aligning with inequity, 28% with equity and 17% of respondents stating that equity issues are not relevant in a crisis. Conclusion: Findings highlight that managing scarcity is complex during a pandemic. Embedding ethical values in recovery and future threats preparedness should be prioritised.",30/10/2022,7/05/2023 7:53,7/05/2023 7:53,7/05/2023 7:53,1-Dec,,3,7,,,Impact of COVID-19 on Organ Donation and Transplantation in the UK,,,,,,,en,"Copyright (c) 2022 Shivani Sharma, Francesco Giovinazzo, Abigail Hucker, Ken Farrington, Chris Lawrence, Guilio Valentino Dalla Riva, Antonia Cronin",,,,www.physicianjnl.net,,Number: 3,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\WNFFBC9D\Sharma et al. - 2022 - Impact of COVID-19 on Organ Donation and Transplan.pdf,,,Renal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined whether urban environmental change drives parallel evolution by sampling 110,019 white clover plants from 6169 populations in 160 cities globally. Plants were assayed for a Mendelian antiherbivore defense that also affects tolerance to abiotic stressors. Urban-rural gradients were associated with the evolution of clines in defense in 47% of cities throughout the world. Variation in the strength of clines was explained by environmental changes in drought stress and vegetation cover that varied among cities. Sequencing 2074 genomes from 26 cities revealed that the evolution of urban-rural clines was best explained by adaptive evolution, but the degree of parallel adaptation varied among cities. Our results demonstrate that urbanization leads to adaptation at a global scale.",18/03/2022,7/05/2023 7:53,7/05/2023 7:53,7/05/2023 7:53,1275-1281,,6586,375,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,science.org (Atypon),,Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\8696H5LU\Santangelo et al. - 2022 - Global urban environmental change drives adaptatio.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Te Ao Māori, waterways are relational knots/nodes/strands in a meshwork of whakapapa that arises from exchanges between earth and sky, land and sea. This approach acknowledges the relations between the atmosphere, surface water and groundwater, vegetation cover, land use, water quality and quantity, the sea, plants, animals, micro-organisms and people; and rivers as beings in their own right, with their own rights. Let the River Speak is codeveloped with the river by a team including iwi researchers, scholars from earth system science, geomorphology, microbiology and infectious diseases, forest ecology, anthropology, creative practice, and business studies. It is holistic, working across different knowledge systems to understand the full complexity of waterways in relationship with people and other life forms over time. At the same time, it is hopeful, providing a relational framework for actions to restore river and estuarine communities to a state of ora (health, well-being, flourishing).",3/07/2022,7/05/2023 7:51,7/05/2023 7:51,7/05/2023 7:51,430-446,,3,56,,,"Tai Timu, Tai Pari, the ebb and flow of the tides",,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2022.2096084,,,,,Estuary; holistic; mātauranga; relational; systems; toi māori; transdisciplinary; wahapū; wānanga,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exploring value bias in ChatGPT using a descriptive value theory,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2304.03612,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03612,"There has been concern about ideological basis and possible discrimination in text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). We test possible value biases in ChatGPT using a psychological value theory. We designed a simple experiment in which we used a number of different probes derived from the Schwartz basic value theory (items from the revised Portrait Value Questionnaire, the value type definitions, value names). We prompted ChatGPT via the OpenAI API repeatedly to generate text and then analyzed the generated corpus for value content with a theory-driven value dictionary using a bag of words approach. Overall, we found little evidence of explicit value bias. The results showed sufficient construct and discriminant validity for the generated text in line with the theoretical predictions of the psychological model, which suggests that the value content was carried through into the outputs with high fidelity. We saw some merging of socially oriented values, which may suggest that these values are less clearly differentiated at a linguistic level or alternatively, this mixing may reflect underlying universal human motivations. We outline some possible applications of our findings for both applications of ChatGPT for corporate usage and policy making as well as future research avenues. We also highlight possible implications of this relatively high-fidelity replication of motivational content using a linguistic model for the theorizing about human values.",7/04/2023,16/04/2024 10:48,16/04/2024 10:48,16/04/2024 10:48,,,,,,,What does ChatGPT return about human values?,,,,,arXiv,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv:2304.03612 [cs],"Comment: 26 pages, 4 Figures, 5 Tables",C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\KPR53PS6\Fischer et al. - 2023 - What does ChatGPT return about human values Explo.pdf; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\6XH3P2L3\2304.html,,,68T50; Computer Science - Computation and Language; Computer Science - Computers and Society; Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv:2304.03612,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This handbook brings together a variety of expert scholars with industry specialists to offer the most authoritative overview of Green Finance to date, presenting the state of the art. It focuses on Green Finance in a comprehensive way, discussing its characteristics, underlying principles and mechanisms. The book carefully illuminates the issues surrounding Green Finance and delineate its boundaries, mapping out and displaying the disparate voices, traditions and professional communities engaged in green and sustainable finance activities. Specifically, it examines the Environmental in the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) measurements, while also discussing the interplay between E, S and G. It develops a range of analytic approaches to the subject, both appreciative and critical, and synthesizes new theoretical constructs that make better sense of hybrid financial relationships. Furthermore, the handbook illustrates existing best practice and theory and critically examines the gaps to derive the necessary future research questions. It highlights the essential issues and debates and provides a robust research agenda. As such, it helps to create an effective market for the various green financing instruments through clarification and standardization.

Here, we illustrate how novel data capture technologies provide exciting opportunities to sample Antarctic biodiversity at wider spatiotemporal scales. Data integration frameworks, such as point process and hierarchical models, can mitigate weaknesses in individual data sets, improving confidence in their predictions. Increasing process knowledge in models is imperative to achieving improved forecasts of Antarctic biodiversity, which can be attained for data-limited species using hybrid modelling frameworks. Leveraging these state-of-the-art tools will help to overcome many of the data scarcity challenges presented by the remoteness of Antarctica, enabling more robust forecasts both near- and long-term.",1/01/2023,7/05/2023 4:49,16/04/2024 9:43,7/05/2023 4:49,24-34,,1,38,,Trends in Ecology & Evolution,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\R757MLJR\S0169534722001732.html,,,climate change; data integration; ecological forecasts; hybrid models; remote sensing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While solar irradiance has traditionally been the primary factor in site selection, accounting for disaster risk assessment is becoming increasingly crucial, particularly in countries prone to natural disasters. Hawkes Bay, New Zealand, holds great promise as a region with high solar potential. Yet, it is susceptible to natural disasters like earthquakes, landslides, and floods. This research aims to identify the most suitable solar farm location in Hawkes Bay by integrating estimated solar energy production with disaster risk assessment. The study employs a two-stages multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach, combining data envelopment analysis (DEA) and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), alongside the utilization of geographical information system (GIS) technology. The finding, among 15 candidate locations, the area in a 5 km radius of Te Haroto weather station has the most potential for solar PV farms. 82 % of the location has low disaster risk, and only 7% of the area is considered high risk.",2023-10,14/04/2024 23:07,16/04/2024 9:43,9/04/2024 5:58,64-69,,,,,,A Double MCDM-GIS Analysis for Solar Power Plant Site Selections in Disaster-Prone Area,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,,,; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10370716; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10370716,,Solar energy; Production; AHP; DEA; disaster risk; GIS; Green products; Landslides; MCDM; Power generation; Renewable energy sources; Risk management; Solar site selection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023 International Conference on Power and Renewable Energy Engineering (PREE),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are data available in the power distribution system from different sources which are often not synchronized in time. Customer smart meter data is existing and is valuable record which provides information of the parts of the power distribution network not visible to the distribution network operator. The purpose of the work is to find initialization process suitable for customer load demand within an active power distribution system and utilize the model to synchronize the customer smart meter load data with the datasets utilized in the power distribution operation such as data available in SCADA. KMean clustering techniques have been tested using actual customer smart meter data collected from ADRRESS Concept website in Australia. The customer datasets are collected for 7 typical winter days and 7 typical summer days. The KMean clustering technique has been widely used to build models from probabilistic natured variables. It is relatively effective and efficient for large datasets as well as datasets on a smaller time scale.,2023-05,8/04/2024 4:44,16/04/2024 9:43,8/04/2024 4:44,409-413,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,,,; ; ; C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\XJ2AYM7E\10261484.html,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10261484; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10261484; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10261484,,Data models; data analytics; Time series analysis; Clustering methods; Distribution networks; KMean; KMean DWT; Power distribution; power distribution network monitoring; Pseudo load data; smart energy meter; Smart meters; Stochastic processes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023 IEEE PES GTD International Conference and Exposition (GTD),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present annotated genome assemblies for four rails from Aotearoa New Zealand: two native volant species, pūkeko Porphyrio melanotus and mioweka Gallirallus philippensis, and two endemic flightless species takahē Porphyrio hochstetteri and weka Gallirallus australis. The quality checks and comparison with other rallid genomes showed that the new assemblies were of high quality and that the annotations could be trusted. Using the sequence read data, heterozygosity was found to be lowest in the endemic flightless species and this probably reflects their relatively small populations. This study significantly increases the number of available rallid genomes and will enable future genomic studies on the evolution of this family.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",1/01/2023,16/04/2024 6:12,16/04/2024 6:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,Issue: 2023.12.25.573037,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.12.25.573037,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But amongst those well-behaved rhythms hide other phenomena, pulsing and fizzing and refusing to play by the same rules. Earth and the life upon it have evolved over billions of years to be right where we are now only because of feedbacks that pushed those systems until they broke. And then those systems adapted, reorganized, and rebuilt. With each new cycle of growth it was feedbacks that created order from disorder and gave rise to a world perfectly optimized for everything it needed to be. Now the latest scientific research is revealing that the exact same patterns that describe plate tectonics, evolution, and mass extinctions also emerge in the heartbeat of our everyday lives, underpinning everything from the cohesion of our social networks and personal relationships to our emotional well-being and spiritual beliefs. In FEEDBACK we embark on a backstage journey revealing how these lesser-known processes keep us operating right where we need to be, poised at the edge of chaos.

A regional atmospheric inversion method has been developed to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of CO2 sinks and sources across New Zealand for 2011–2013. This approach infers net air–sea and air–land CO2 fluxes from measurement records, using back-trajectory simulations from the Numerical Atmospheric dispersion Modelling Environment (NAME) Lagrangian dispersion model, driven by meteorology from the New Zealand Limited Area Model (NZLAM) weather prediction model. The inversion uses in situ measurements from two fixed sites, Baring Head on the southern tip of New Zealand's North Island (41.408° S, 174.871° E) and Lauder from the central South Island (45.038° S, 169.684° E), and ship board data from monthly cruises between Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. A range of scenarios is used to assess the sensitivity of the inversion method to underlying assumptions and to ensure robustness of the results. The results indicate a strong seasonal cycle in terrestrial land fluxes from the South Island of New Zealand, especially in western regions covered by indigenous forest, suggesting higher photosynthetic and respiratory activity than is evident in the current a priori land process model. On the annual scale, the terrestrial biosphere in New Zealand is estimated to be a net CO2 sink, removing 98 (±37) Tg CO2 yr−1 from the atmosphere on average during 2011–2013. This sink is much larger than the reported 27 Tg CO2 yr−1 from the national inventory for the same time period. The difference can be partially reconciled when factors related to forest and agricultural management and exports, fossil fuel emission estimates, hydrologic fluxes, and soil carbon change are considered, but some differences are likely to remain. Baseline uncertainty, model transport uncertainty, and limited sensitivity to the northern half of the North Island are the main contributors to flux uncertainty.",2/01/2017,22/06/2022 23:46,29/05/2023 12:24,15/06/2022 2:17,47-76,,1,17,,Atmos.

This study utilises novel nationwide data to calculate the transmission risk and potential inequity of infectious disease outbreaks through use of network analysis. METHODS: Nationwide employment and education microdata (∼4.7 million individuals in Aotearoa New Zealand) were used to develop the Aotearoa Co-incidence Network (ACN). The ACN considers connections generated when individuals are employed at the same workplaces or enrolled at the same schools. Through forms of network analysis, connections between geospatial areas can be established and provide proxy measures of infectious disease transmission risk. The ACN was also overlayed with nationwide population vulnerability data based on the number of older adults (>65 years) and individuals with long-term health conditions. FINDINGS: We identify areas that have both high potential transmission risk (i.e., highly connected) and high vulnerability to infectious diseases. Community detection identified geographic boundaries that can be relevant to the application of regional restrictions for limiting infectious disease transmission. INTERPRETATION: Integrating novel network science and geospatial analytics provides a simple way to study infectious disease transmission risk and population vulnerability to outbreaks. Our replicable method has utility for researchers globally with access to such data. It can help inform equitable preparation for, and responses to infectious disease outbreaks.

Results are calculated from N = 100,000 independent realisations of the stochastic model. We find that strategies that rely on home isolation are significantly higher risk than the current mandatory 14-day stay in government-managed isolation. Nevertheless, combinations of testing and home isolation can still reduce the risk of a community outbreak to around one outbreak per 100 infected travellers. We also find that, under some circumstances, using daily lateral flow tests or a combination of lateral flow tests and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests can reduce risk to a comparable or lower level than using PCR tests alone. Combined with controls on the number of travellers from countries with high prevalence of COVID-19, our results allow different options for managing the risk of COVID-19 at the border to be compared. This can be used to inform strategies for relaxing border controls in a phased way, while limiting the risk of community outbreaks as vaccine coverage increases.",28/12/2021,22/06/2022 23:46,29/05/2023 11:44,7/05/2023 8:00,184-198,,1,7,,Infect Dis Model,"Effect of vaccination, border testing, and quarantine requirements on the risk of COVID-19 in New Zealand",,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 34977439 PMCID: PMC8712670,,"C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\QSM5CFPD\Steyn et al. - 2021 - Effect of vaccination, border testing, and quarant.pdf; ",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8712670/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies of DNA methylation (epigenetic changes that can affect the gene transcription) have found evidence of changes in immune cells for ME/CFS. However these studies have been limited by their small sample size, precluding the ability to detect changes to methylation of smaller magnitude. Therefore, to achieve a larger sample size and detect small changes to DNA methylation, we aggregate three comparable datasets and analyse them in unison. We find 10,824 differentially methylated genes, with a very small average change. We then turn our attention to the network structure of the Protein-Protein interaction, which we built from the currently known interactions of relevant proteins, and localising the network cartography framework, we identify 184 hub genes. A distinct structuring emerges, with different hub types playing differing, meaningful, biological roles. Supporting previous theories about ME/CFS, Gene ontology enrichment analysis of these hubs reveal that they are involved in immune system processes, including response to TGF-β and LPS, as well as mitochondrial functioning. We also show that dopaminergic signalling may potentially contribute to immune pathology in ME/CFS.

It has also been linked to the introduction or strengthening of regulations related to digital money, with some central banks identifying the need for a comprehensive regulatory framework as a precondition for successful CBDC implementation. However, this type of central bank intervention can be seen by market participants as a threat to both confidentiality and potential cryptocurrency profitability. Linking computationally analyzed social media data with hand-coded data from the websites of major central banks, we test the effects of CBDC-related announcements and social media sentiment. on 210 blockchain and cryptocurrency fund products. We find that for a large majority of theseproducts, central bank announcements elicit significant returns and volatility responses, with somevariation in response related to geographical region. Both central bank announcements and positivesocial media CBDC-related sentiment are associated with reduced cryptocurrency exchange tradedfund (ETF) returns and increased volatility.

Here we provide context for understanding the scholarship landscape in Aotearoa, including how scholarships are understood in relation to dominant neoliberal framings of higher education and persistent inequities within the sector. We present data which provides insight into the current inequities in Summer, Masters and PhD scholarship values. The average value of PhD scholarships has remained stagnant between 2011 and 2019 resulting in the average being $11,238 less than the Living Wage in 2019. We show that the average length of time full-time PhD students take to complete their doctorates exceeds the three-year tenure of scholarships. We argue the status-quo of low scholarships, supplemented by postgraduate ‘sweat’, excludes people from participating in postgraduate education, preventing them and their communities from realising the public benefits that such an education can produce. We suggest that these inadequacies could be addressed through (1) raising Summer, Masters and PhD scholarships to the living wage; (2) extending tenure of PhD scholarships; and (3) reinstating the postgraduate student allowance.",1/12/2022,27/05/2023 3:16,27/05/2023 3:16,27/05/2023 3:16,505-523,,2,57,,NZ J Educ Stud,Sweat Equity,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\P6SW7X3H\Soar et al. - 2022 - Sweat Equity Student Scholarships in Aotearoa New.pdf,,,PhD; Inequity; Postgraduate; Scholarships,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In response, Māori academics continue to advocate for culturally ethical practice; supported by a seemingly inexhaustible list of anecdotal evidence pertaining to the colonial violence experienced by Māori communities subjected to western research. Whilst recognising the historical and contemporary role of scientific research is vital to the safety and well-being of Māori communities, this generates a narrative that dissuades researchers from engaging with them. We question ‘who is the audience’ for this narrative and ‘does this generalised message unintentionally inhibit our rangatahi in these spaces?’ Messages of aroha and whānaungatanga are sorely missing from this research narrative leading to insinuations that can alienate rangatahi in the research space from working with their communities, whānau, hapū and iwi.

Acute assessment services have been implemented at many hospitals internationally to assist in maintaining patient flow for identified groups of patients attending the ED. Identifying the risks and benefits, and optimal configurations of these services may be beneficial to those wishing to utilise an acute assessment service to improve patient flow. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of acute assessment services on patient flow following attendance at a hospital ED. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Embase and two trials registers on 24 September 2022 to identify studies. No restrictions were imposed on publication year, publication type, or publication language. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies eligible for inclusion were randomised trials and cluster-randomised trials with at least two intervention and two control sites. Participants were adults (as defined by study authors) receiving care either in the ED or the acute assessment service, where both were based in the hospital setting. The comparison was hospital-based acute assessment services with usual, ED-only care. The outcomes of this review were mortality at time point closest to 30 days, length of stay in the service (in minutes), and waiting time to see a doctor (in minutes).

It examines the intersection of accounting and tax for Māori entrepreneurs and their relational interactions with the Inland Revenue Department (IRD)/state/Crown and accountants by considering the contextual factors of history, culture and society of Māori.                                         Design/methodology/approach               Qualitative research was adopted using face-to-face in-depth interviews with 34 participants and reviewing government documents. The authors analyse the tax compliance practice by drawing on Bourdieu's concepts of field, capital and habitus to conceptualise the tax field as a site of struggle for power and control by the IRD, accountants and indigenous entrepreneurs.                                         Findings                                This study demonstrates how the tax field is structured as a game between tax reporting, taxpaying and monitoring functions. The position within the field is determined by the actor's access to the relevant capitals and habitus. It identifies how accounting, given its centrality to tax compliance, facilitates the power relations between the IRD, accountants and Māori entrepreneurs. The Eurocentric accounting-based tax reporting and the contextual factors illuminate how indigenous entrepreneurs are being dominated in the tax field. They experienced cultural dissonance with conflicting responsibilities when traversing the collectivistic indigenous and tax fields. Their collectivism involves sharing resources as they cherish                 whanaungatanga                 (relationship, kinship) and                 manaakitanga                 (kindness, generosity), which are at odds and are not valued in the tax field.                                                        Practical implications               It is an empirical illustration of the connection between accounting, tax and power for indigenous taxpayers and their relationship with the IRD/Crown and accountants. It has practical implications for developing and enhancing tax compliance in jurisdictions with indigenous taxpayers. Such an understanding is helpful for policymakers, government, business agencies and the accounting professions when assisting, empowering and educating indigenous groups regarding tax compliance.                                         Originality/value                                This paper responds to the call for accounting research with modern-day indigenous peoples rather than historical ones. The paper fills a gap in the accounting and tax literature by examining the tax compliance practice of indigenous small and medium enterprise (SME) entrepreneurs using Bourdieu's framework. It identifies how the role of accounting creates, maintains and reinforces power structures in the tax field. Tax/accounting reporting based on Eurocentric rules disempowers and alienates indigenous entrepreneurs. They misrecognise their actions in reproducing the existing power structures in the tax field due to deeply held historical and cultural factors about the fear of the Crown/state and their practice of                 rangitaratanga                 (esteeming authorities).",19/06/2023,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 0:52,15/04/2024 5:47,1350-1378,,5,36,,AAAJ,"Accounting, tax compliance and New Zealand indigenous entrepreneurs",,,,,,,en,https://www.emerald.com/insight/site-policies,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach               This paper implemented a qualitative field study design collecting interview data from church members from the Solomon Islands, Tonga and Fiji. Data were also collected through focus group discussions, document reviews, website analysis and participant observations. Pierre Bourdieu’s thinking on symbolic violence, doxa and capital are used to interpret the findings.                                         Findings               This paper’s main contribution shows that while there is a divine and profane divide, social agents, given their agency, can move back and forth from one side of the divide to the other. Accounting as a control device does not include features such as faith, which is helpful for decision-making; accordingly, religion is relied upon when it comes to decision-making. In contrast, accounting has features that are useful for stewardship purposes. Accordingly, when it comes to the church’s stewardship function accounting in the form of financial reports is relied upon.                                         Research limitations/implications               Pacific Island culture almost permeates all facets of life, including church life; however, this study did not clarify this.

Practical implications               This rich empirical study describes the control dynamics and the tension between accounting and religion in a religious organisation. Accounting needs to adapt to churches’ unique characteristics, whereby religious/doctrinal beliefs must be accounted for and respected. Unlike in the corporate world, accountants in churches cannot fully practice their training or exercise the kind of influence they usually hold in organisations due to their religious belief systems.                                         Originality/value               To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is one of a few studies on the religion-accounting relationship. While the focus of earlier studies was generally on a secular and sacred divide, this study looks at coexisting of accounting and religion.

DESIGN: A comparative observational study. SETTING: NZ; the most recent 5 years of available data on mortality events (2013-2017), hospitalisations and non-admitted hospital patient events (both 2015-2019). PARTICIPANTS: Numerator data included deaths (n=156 521), hospitalisations (n=13 020 042) and selected non-admitted patient events (n=44 596 471) for the total NZ population during the study period. Annual denominators, by 5-year age group, sex, ethnicity (Māori, non-Māori) and rurality, were estimated from Census 2013 and Census 2018. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary measures were the unadjusted rural incidence rates for 17 health outcome and service utilisation indicators, using each rurality classification. Secondary measures were the age-sex-adjusted rural and urban incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for the same indicators and rurality classifications. RESULTS: Total population rural rates of all indicators examined were substantially higher using the GCH compared with the UREP, and for all except paediatric hospitalisations when the UA was applied. All-cause rural mortality rates using the GCH, UA and UREP were 82, 67 and 50 per 10 000 person-years, respectively. Rural-urban all-cause mortality IRRs were higher using the GCH (1.21, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.22), compared with the UA (0.92, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.94) and UREP (0.67, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.68). Age-sex-adjusted rural and urban IRRs were also higher using the GCH than the UREP for all outcomes, and higher than the UA for 13 of the 17 outcomes. A similar pattern was observed for Māori with higher rural rates for all outcomes using the GCH compared with the UREP, and 11 of the 17 outcomes using the UA. For Māori, rural-urban all-cause mortality IRRs for Māori were higher using the GCH (1.34, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.38), compared with the UA (1.23, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.27) and UREP (1.15, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.19). CONCLUSIONS: Substantial variation in rural health outcome and service utilisation rates were identified with different classifications. Rural rates using the GCH are substantially higher than the UREP.

To reduce impacts induced by the introduction and spread of exotic species, biosecurity interventions are put into place. These interventions often rely on risk-assessment procedures, whereby biosecurity practitioners (which includes researchers, stakeholders such as national park managers, and all other decision makers who determine when and how to protect biodiversity) attempt to preemptively identify and predict which exotic species could potentially become a threat to natural ecosystems. In theory, extensive field and experimental studies would be required to accurately and precisely determine the risks of biological invasion of a species or group of species. However, due to a lack of resources or knowledge, such critical studies are limited. As a result, biosecurity practitioners rarely have a full picture of the extent to which the exotic species has and will spread at the time of decision making. Hence, they instead opt for preventive measures such as identifying and managing potential target exotic species which are likely to be invasive or dispersal pathways through which exotic species are likely to be introduced and spread. As most of the uncertainties pertaining to biosecurity interventions lie in the resolution of data made available to practitioners at the time of decision making, we first present some of the different types of information which are readily available during the risk-assessment procedure. We then highlight how one could exploit these different resolutions of data during the risk-assessment procedure using network analysis to better understand human-mediated dispersal of exotic species. By doing so, our paper puts forward what network analysis has to offer practitioners in the context of biosecurity interventions.",2023-11,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 0:49,15/04/2024 5:40,3369-3389,,11,25,,Biol Invasions,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\ULLTLP5W\Runghen et al. - 2023 - Using network analysis to study and manage human-m.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To aid our response, we rapidly set up and scaled our use of genomic technologies to help identify community cases of COVID-19, to understand how they had arisen, and to determine the appropriate action to maintain elimination. Once New Zealand pivoted from elimination to suppression in late 2021, our genomic response changed to focusing on identifying new variants arriving at the border, tracking their incidence around the country, and examining any links between specific variants and increased disease severity.

Evolutionary studies on invasive populations are poised to tackle some of these pressing questions, including understanding the mechanisms behind rapid adaptation, and how it facilitates population persistence within a novel environment. Investigation of these questions are assisted through recent developments in experimental, sequencing, and analytical protocols; in particular, the growing accessibility of next generation sequencing has enabled a broader range of taxa to be characterised. In this perspective, we discuss recent genetic findings within the invasive European starlings in Australia, and outline some critical next steps within this research system. Further, we use discoveries within this study system to guide discussion of pressing future research directions more generally within the fields of population and evolutionary genetics, including the use of historic specimens, phenotypic data, non-SNP genetic variants (e.g., structural variants), and pan-genomes.

The main objective of this study was to compare patients with MAFLD and non-MAFLD with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) included in a nationally representative cohort.                                         Methods               We analysed 6882 consecutive patients with HCC enrolled from 2002 to 2019 by 23 Italian Liver Cancer centres to compare epidemiological and future trends in three subgroups: pure, single aetiology MAFLD (S-MAFLD); mixed aetiology MAFLD (metabolic and others, M-MAFLD); and non-MAFLD HCC.                                         Results               MAFLD was diagnosed in the majority of patients with HCC (68.4%). The proportion of both total MAFLD and S-MAFLD HCC significantly increased over time (from 50.4% and 3.6% in 2002–2003, to 77.3% and 28.9% in 2018–2019, respectively, p<0.001). In Italy S-MAFLD HCC is expected to overcome M-MAFLD HCC in about 6 years. Patients with S-MAFLD HCC were older, more frequently men and less frequently cirrhotic with clinically relevant portal hypertension and a surveillance-related diagnosis. They had more frequently large tumours and extrahepatic metastases. After weighting, and compared with patients with non-MAFLD, S-MAFLD and M-MAFLD HCC showed a significantly lower overall (p=0.026, p=0.004) and HCC-related (p<0.001, for both) risk of death. Patients with S-MAFLD HCC showed a significantly higher risk of non-HCC-related death (p=0.006).                                         Conclusions               The prevalence of MAFLD HCC in Italy is rapidly increasing to cover the majority of patients with HCC.

This is at odds with standard mathematical models based solely on between-species interactions, which show mutualisms to be inherently unstable. Models incorporating parameters for punishment and reward strategies demonstrate that the range of conditions over which stability is observed can be extended; however, the role of community-level dynamics impacted by within-species interactions remains relatively unexplored. Here we develop a general and readily applicable approach for analysing a broad range of mutualisms. By incorporating within-species interactions, we show that mutualisms can be stably maintained across diverse environmental conditions without introducing changes to between-species interaction parameters. Further, a balance of within- and between-species interactions is sufficient to allow the persistence of mutualisms encountering ecological perturbations. Our simple and robust framework resonates with emerging empirical data highlighting the role of community-level interactions and population dynamics in maintaining mutualisms.",2023-12,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 0:59,15/04/2024 5:32,1066-1087,,4,13,,Dyn Games Appl,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\UI5ZKSY2\Gokhale et al. - 2023 - Eco-evolutionary Logic of Mutualisms.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, we examine the embodied experiences of research leadership, as encountered by participants at Aotearoa New Zealand's universities and a nationally funded Centre of Research Excellence. It is within such institutions and organisations, built on colonial and patriarchal values, that experiences of marginalisation, oppression and harassment have been documented. We destabilise the apparently static nature of this ‘research system monolith’ by taking up MacLeavy, Fannin and Larner's (2021) provocation of a feminist approach to boldly do leadership differently.

Temporal variability in aggregate properties, like total biomass or abundance, is typically lower in communities with higher species diversity (i.e., the diversity–stability relationship [DSR]). At broader spatial extents, regional‐scale aggregate variability is also lower with higher regional diversity (in plant systems) and with lower spatial synchrony. However, focusing exclusively on aggregate properties of communities may overlook potentially destabilizing compositional shifts. It is not yet clear how diversity is related to different components of variability across spatial scales, nor whether regional DSRs emerge across a broad range of organisms and ecosystem types. To test these questions, we compiled a large collection of long‐term metacommunity data spanning a wide range of taxonomic groups (e.g., birds, fish, plants, invertebrates) and ecosystem types (e.g., deserts, forests, oceans). We applied a newly developed quantitative framework for jointly analyzing aggregate and compositional variability across scales. We quantified DSRs for composition and aggregate variability in local communities and metacommunities. At the local scale, more diverse communities were less variable, but this effect was stronger for aggregate than compositional properties. We found no stabilizing effect of γ‐diversity on metacommunity variability, but β‐diversity played a strong role in reducing compositional spatial synchrony, which reduced regional variability. Spatial synchrony differed among taxa, suggesting differences in stabilization by spatial processes. However, metacommunity variability was more strongly driven by local variability than by spatial synchrony. Across a broader range of taxa, our results suggest that high γ‐diversity does not consistently stabilize aggregate properties at regional scales without sufficient spatial β‐diversity to reduce spatial synchrony.",2023-09,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 0:58,15/04/2024 5:46,e4136,,9,104,,Ecology,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\WJR75FVF\Wisnoski et al. - 2023 - Diversity–stability relationships across organism .pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These properties are ubiquitous in systems as varied as the internet, transportation, brain or epidemic networks, which are thus unified under the hyperbolic network interpretation on a surface of constant negative curvature. Although a few studies have shown that hyperbolic models can generate community structures, another salient feature observed in real networks, we argue that the current models are overlooking the choice of the latent space dimensionality that is required to adequately represent clustered networked data. We show that there is an important qualitative difference between the lowest-dimensional model and its higher-dimensional counterparts with respect to how similarity between nodes restricts connection probabilities. Since more dimensions also increase the number of nearest neighbors for angular clusters representing communities, considering only one more dimension allows us to generate more realistic and diverse community structures.",18/04/2023,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 0:58,,pgad136-pgad136,,5,2,,PNAS Nexus,,,,,,,,eng,,,PubMed,37181048,,,Number: 5 Place: England,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\NMCUFIKP\Désy et al. - 2023 - Dimension matters when modeling network communitie.pdf; ; ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10167553/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10167553/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we investigate the level of protozoa detection by molecular methods in campylobacteriosis cases missed through antigen-based assays and investigate different molecular testing protocols. We report findings from two observational studies; the first among 111 people during a               Campylobacter               outbreak and the second during normal surveillance activities among 158 people presenting with diarrhoea and a positive               Campylobacter               test, but negative               Cryptosporidium               and               Giardia               antigen-based test results.

Importantly, there is no standardised description of each rural hospital’s catchment boundary and the characteristics of the population living within this area.     Aim   To define and describe a catchment population for each of New Zealand’s rural hospitals.     Methods   An exploratory approach to developing catchments was employed. Geographic Information Systems were used to develop drive-time-based geographic catchments, and administrative health data (National Minimum Data Set and Primary Health Organisation Data Set) informed service utilisation-based catchments. Catchments were defined at both the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) and domicile levels, and linked to census-based population data, the Geographic Classification for Health, and the area-level New Zealand Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation (NZDep2018).     Results   Our results highlight considerable heterogeneity in the size (max: 57 564, min: 5226) and characteristics of populations served by rural hospitals. Substantial differences in the age structure, ethnic composition, socio-economic profile, ‘remoteness’ and projected future populations, are noted.     Discussion   In providing a standardised description of each rural hospital’s catchment boundary and its population characteristics, the considerable heterogeneity of the communities served by rural hospitals, both in size, rurality and socio-demographic characteristics, is highlighted.

However, since nations are connected in various ways, such as via spatial proximity and shared cultural ancestry, cross-national analyses often violate assumptions of non-independence, inflating false positive rates. Here, we show that, despite being recognised as an important statistical pitfall for over 200 years, cross-national research in economics and psychology still does not sufficiently account for non-independence. In a review of the 100 highest-cited cross-national studies of economic development and values, we find that controls for non-independence are rare. When studies do control for non-independence, our simulations suggest that most commonly used methods are insufficient for reducing false positives in non-independent data. In reanalyses of twelve previous cross-national correlations, half of the estimates are compatible with no association after controlling for non-independence using global proximity matrices.

Design/methodology/approach               The authors’ critical reflections are informed by the literature and websites of IASB, International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), global reporting initiative (GRI) and other relevant organisations. The authors use Bourdieu’s concept of field to support their analysis and critique.                                         Findings               The authors highlight how a disrupted standard-setting field will be a distraction from efforts to address real sustainability issues and concerns. Determining the “legitimate” sustainability reporting standards is likely to be an outcome of struggles between occupants in the sustainability standard-setting field. Accordingly, the shape of legitimate standards will be defined by those with power. The concern is the priority and the motive underpinning the endeavours of those with power. The authors propose that it is important for both the ISSB and GRI to serve the interest of a broad range of actors, including those who are not likely to have a say in sustainability reporting standard setting.                                         Practical implications               This paper contributes to sustainability reporting practice by putting forward a case for strengthening current sustainability reporting practices with appropriate changes to overcome some of the criticisms of the GRI.                                         Social implications               The authors highlight that there is a much broader group of stakeholders who require sustainability information and that it is important that the sustainability reporting standards serve the information needs of all stakeholders and not just those of the dominant actors. However, the ISSB with its economic focus will inevitably focus on the concern of investors and market participants.                                         Originality/value               The originality in this paper is the use of Bourdieu’s concept of field to theoretically highlight how a new standard setter may disrupt the sustainability standard-setting field and act as a distraction from efforts to address sustainability issues and concerns that the world faces.",18/07/2023,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 0:57,15/04/2024 5:27,776-791,,4,14,,SAMPJ,,,,,,,,en,https://www.emerald.com/insight/site-policies,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eradication is often a default conservation management strategy even when it may not be feasible for a variety of reasons. Assessment of the substantive socioeconomic and ecological impacts of invasive alien species (IAS), both negative and positive, is increasingly viewed as an important step in management.                                                     We argue that one solution to IAS management is to align models of alien species management with Indigenous management frameworks that are relational and biocultural. We make the theoretical case that centring Indigenous management frameworks promises to strengthen overall management responses and outcomes because they attend directly to human and environmental justice concerns.                                                     We unpack the origins of the ‘introduced species paradigm’ to understand how binary framing of so‐called ‘aliens’ and ‘natives’ recalls harmful histories and alienates Indigenous stewardship. Such a paradigm thereby may limit application of Indigenous frameworks and management, and impede long‐term biodiversity protection solutions.                                                     We highlight how biocultural practices applied by Indigenous Peoples to IAS centre protecting relationships, fulfilling responsibilities and realising justice.                                                     Finally, we argue for a pluralistic vision that acknowledges multiple alternative Indigenous relationships and responses to introduced and IAS which can contribute to vibrant futures where all elements of society, including kin in the natural world, are able to flourish.

This may result in reduced pressure to produce chemical defences that act against herbivores. We measured the most abundant secondary metabolites found in Rumex spp., namely oxalates, phenols and tannins. To test this hypothesis, we compared native (UK) and introduced (NZ) provenances of three different Rumex species (R. obtusifolius, R. crispus and R. conglomeratus, Polygonaceae) to assess whether any significant differences existed in their levels of chemical defences in either leaves and roots. All three species have previously been shown to support a lower diversity of insect herbivores and experience less herbivory in the introduced range. We further examined leaf herbivory on plants from both provenances when grown together in a common garden experiment in New Zealand to test whether any differences in damage might be consistent with variation in the quantity of chemical defences. We found that two Rumex species (R. obtusifolius and R. crispus) showed no evidence for a reduction in chemical defences, while a third (R. conglomeratus) showed only limited evidence. The common garden experiment revealed that the leaves analysed had low levels of herbivory (~ 0.5%) with no differences in damage between provenances for any of the three study species. Roots tended to have a higher concentration of tannins than shoots, but again showed no difference between the provenances. As such, the findings of this study provide no evidence for lower plant investments in chemical defences, suggesting that other factors explain the success of Rumex spp. in New Zealand.",2023-06,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 0:56,,276-286,,5-Jun,49,,J Chem Ecol,,,,,,,,eng,,,PubMed,37121960,,,Number: 5-6 Edition: 2023/05/01 Place: United States,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\XAP8PPGM\Costan et al. - 2023 - Comparing the Above and Below-Ground Chemical Defe.pdf; ; ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10495513/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10495513/,*Rumex; Alien species; Chemical defences; Herbivory; Introduced; Introduced Species; Native; Plant invasion; Plant Leaves; Plants; Tannins; Weeds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Space-borne remote sensing can complement in-field missions when safety and accessibility concerns limit post-earthquake operations on the ground. However, the implementation of remote sensing techniques in post-disaster missions is limited by the lack of methods that combine different techniques and integrate them with field survey data. This paper presents a new approach for rapid post-earthquake building damage assessment and landslide mapping, based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The proposed texture-based building damage classification approach exploits very high resolution post-earthquake SAR data integrated with building survey data. For landslide mapping, a backscatter intensity-based landslide detection approach, which also includes the separation between landslides and flooded areas, is combined with optical-based manual inventories. The approach was implemented during the joint Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance, GeoHazards International and Earthquake Engineering Field Investigation Team mission that followed the 2021 Haiti Earthquake and Tropical Cyclone Grace.",30/06/2023,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 0:55,15/04/2024 5:31,,,,,,Bull Earthquake Eng,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\PFAL5AVY\Giardina et al. - 2023 - Combining remote sensing techniques and field surv.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2021, Soilsafe Aotearoa surveyed the adult population of New Zealand about how they value soil, particularly values related to how they care about and are concerned about soil. Pursuant to this study, Soilsafe Kids (the outreach branch of Soilsafe Aotearoa) developed a combined research and outreach program to collect a supplemental data set of children’s soil values, so both adults’ and children’s voices can be considered when understanding the implications of different practices and how to care for presently “uncared for” or neglected soils in the future.                                         Objective               The program not only asks primary school students about their soil values but also aims to teach them about soil from many disciplinary perspectives to enhance their understanding and awareness of soil, and, more broadly, for knowledge production.                                         Methods               Here we describe the research protocol used in this Soilsafe Kids program. This program uses surveys (in the form of worksheets), focus groups (introduced as group discussions), and art projects to learn what children think about soil in Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland. We have received ethics approval from the University of Auckland’s Human Participants Ethics Committee (reference number 23556) on March 25, 2022, for 3 years.                                         Results               We have begun recruiting participants and delivering the Soilsafe Kids program in schools across Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland. Our data collection is ongoing with final student engagement in the first quarter of 2023.

Conclusions               Once this study is complete, we will disseminate the final results to the research community, stakeholders, and the local community through conference presentations, journal articles, hui (meetings), on our website, and in art exhibits. We note that although Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland is home to the majority of people living in Aotearoa New Zealand, the Auckland region only represents a small portion of Aotearoa New Zealand’s land, and findings are not generalizable to Aotearoa New Zealand as a whole.

Each group created a “Catchment Journey,” a graphical artwork that told a story of their land and people, and their restoration activities. Whilst each of these “Journeys” was unique, the following common elements were important for knowledge sharing: (1) the role of respected storytellers (e.g., community champions) in influencing restoration in their community; (2) recognition of responsibility to act (e.g., concern for future generations, land stewardship, prosperity and community cohesion); and (3) authenticity (e.g., true and honest stories, including weaknesses, threats and hardship). Participants recommended including each of these key elements in collective catchment storytelling to encourage large scale freshwater restoration.",13/01/2023,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 0:55,15/04/2024 5:29,1061634,,,7,,Front.

However, the most notable critique of the EMH is the inability to model periods of out-of-equilibrium dynamics without significant external news. When such dynamics emerge endogenously, the traditional economic frameworks prove insufficient. This work offers an alternate perspective explaining the endogenous emergence of punctuated out-of-equilibrium dynamics based on bounded rational agents. In a concise market entrance game, we show how boundedly rational strategic reasoning can lead to endogenously emerging crises, exhibiting fat tails in returns. We also show how other common stylized facts, such as clustered volatility, arise due to agent diversity (or lack thereof) and the varying learning updates across the agents.

In this work, we investigate some of the underlying assumptions of rationality, such as mutual consistency and best response, and consider ways to relax these assumptions using concepts from level-               k               reasoning and quantal response equilibrium (QRE) respectively. Specifically, we propose an information-theoretic two-parameter model called the quantal hierarchy model, which can relax both mutual consistency and best response while still approximating level-               k               , QRE, or typical Nash equilibrium behavior in the limiting cases. The model is based on a recursive form of the variational free energy principle, representing higher-order reasoning as (pseudo) sequential decision-making in extensive-form game tree. This representation enables us to treat simultaneous games in a similar manner to sequential games, where reasoning resources deplete throughout the game-tree. Bounds in player processing abilities are captured as information costs, where future branches of reasoning are discounted, implying a hierarchy of players where lower-level players have fewer processing resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the quantal hierarchy model in several canonical economic games, both simultaneous and sequential, using out-of-sample modelling.",2024-02,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 0:54,15/04/2024 5:30,71-111,,1,96,,Theory Decis,Bounded rationality for relaxing best response and mutual consistency,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\Z4CDJXC8\Evans and Prokopenko - 2024 - Bounded rationality for relaxing best response and.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the affected species were the large flightless South Island takahē (               Porphyrio hochstetteri               ) and the moho (North Island takahē;               P. mantelli               ), with the latter rendered extinct and the former reduced to a single relictual population. Little is known about the evolutionary history of these species prior to their decline and/or extinction. Here we sequenced mitochondrial genomes from takahē and moho subfossils (12 takahē and 4 moho) and retrieved comparable sequence data from takahē museum skins (               n                = 5) and contemporary individuals (               n                = 17) to examine the phylogeny and recent evolutionary history of these species.

Temporal genetic comparisons show that takahē have lost much of their mitochondrial genetic diversity, likely due to a sudden demographic decline soon after human arrival (~750 years ago). Time‐calibrated phylogenetic analyses strongly support a sister species relationship between takahē and moho, suggesting these flightless taxa diverged around 1.5 million years ago, following a single colonisation of New Zealand by a flighted               Porphyrio               ancestor approximately 4 million years ago.

In late 2021, high vaccine coverage enabled the country to transition away from the elimination strategy to a mitigation strategy. However, given negligible levels of immunity from prior infection, this required careful planning and an effective public health response to avoid uncontrolled outbreaks and unmanageable health impacts. Here, we develop an age-structured model for the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 including the effects of vaccination, case isolation, contact tracing, border controls and population-wide control measures. We use this model to investigate how epidemic trajectories may respond to different control strategies, and to explore trade-offs between restrictions in the community and restrictions at the border. We find that a low case tolerance strategy, with a quick change to stricter public health measures in response to increasing cases, reduced the health burden by a factor of three relative to a high tolerance strategy, but almost tripled the time spent in national lockdowns. Increasing the number of border arrivals was found to have a negligible effect on health burden once high vaccination rates were achieved and community transmission was widespread.",2023-02,29/06/2024 23:56,29/06/2024 23:56,29/06/2024 23:56,220766,,2,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon),,Publisher: Royal Society,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\ZTCYVLVR\Vattiato et al. - 2023 - Modelling Aotearoa New Zealand's COVID-19 protecti.pdf,,,COVID-19; vaccination; public health; border restrictions; Delta; lockdown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This strategy delivered one of the lowest pandemic mortality rates in the world. However, quantitative estimates of the population-level health benefits of vaccination are lacking. Here, we use a validated mathematical model to investigate counterfactual scenarios with differing levels of vaccine coverage in different age and ethnicity groups. The model builds on earlier research by adding age- and time-dependent case ascertainment, the effect of antiviral medications, improved hospitalisation rate estimates, and the impact of relaxing control measures. The model was used for scenario analysis and policy advice for the New Zealand Government in 2022 and 2023. We compare the number of Covid-19 hospitalisations, deaths, and years of life lost in each counterfactual scenario to a baseline scenario that is fitted to epidemiological data between January 2022 and June 2023. Our results estimate that vaccines saved 6650 (95% credible interval [4424, 10180]) lives, and prevented 74500 [51000, 115400] years of life lost and 45100 [34400, 55600] hospitalisations during this 18-month period. Making the same comparison before the benefit of antiviral medications is accounted for, the estimated number of lives saved by vaccines increases to 7604 [5080, 11942]. Due to inequities in the vaccine rollout, vaccination rates among M\=aori were lower than in people of European ethnicity. Our results show that, if vaccination rates had been equitable, an estimated 11-26% of the 292 M\=aori Covid-19 deaths that were recorded in this time period could have been prevented. We conclude that Covid-19 vaccination greatly reduced health burden in New Zealand and that equity needs to be a key focus of future vaccination programmes.",2024-02,27/06/2024 3:37,27/06/2024 3:37,27/06/2024 3:37,1383-1391,,6,42,,Vaccine,The impact of Covid-19 vaccination in Aotearoa New Zealand,,,,,,,en,,,,,arXiv.org,,"arXiv:2401.09679 [physics, q-bio]",,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\GE4G628I\Datta et al. - 2024 - The impact of Covid-19 vaccination in Aotearoa New.pdf,,,Quantitative Biology - Populations and Evolution; Physics - Physics and Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, patterns in temporal variability across trophic levels and the mechanisms that produce them remain poorly understood. Here we analyzed the abundance time series of spatially structured communities (i.e., metacommunities) spanning basal resources to top predators from 355 freshwater sites across three continents. Specifically, we used a hierarchical partitioning method to disentangle the propagation of temporal variability in abundance across spatial scales and trophic levels. We then used structural equation modeling to determine if the strength and direction of relationships between temporal variability, synchrony, biodiversity, and environmental and spatial settings depended on trophic level and spatial scale. We found that temporal variability in abundance decreased from producers to tertiary consumers but did so mainly at the local scale. Species population synchrony within sites increased with trophic level, whereas synchrony among communities decreased. At the local scale, temporal variability in precipitation and species diversity were associated with population variability (linear partial coefficient, β = 0.23) and population synchrony (β = −0.39) similarly across trophic levels, respectively. At the regional scale, community synchrony was not related to climatic or spatial predictors, but the strength of relationships between metacommunity variability and community synchrony decreased systematically from top predators (β = 0.73) to secondary consumers (β = 0.54), to primary consumers (β = 0.30) to producers (β = 0). Our results suggest that mobile predators may often stabilize metacommunities by buffering variability that originates at the base of food webs. This finding illustrates that the trophic structure of metacommunities, which integrates variation in organismal body size and its correlates, should be considered when investigating ecological stability in natural systems. More broadly, our work advances the notion that temporal stability is an emergent property of ecosystems that may be threatened in complex ways by biodiversity loss and habitat fragmentation.",2024-02,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 22:36,15/04/2024 5:41,e4219,,2,105,,Ecology,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Often overlooked in cluster analysis is the variability that occurs within any clusters generated. This is particularly important in the geophysics where clusters are often generated with a focus on interpretability over mathematical optimization. Two metrics, the Davies‐Bouldin index and the subsom entropy, are used to identify clusters with large internal variability. These metrics are applied to an example set of clusters from prior research that were generated using cloud top pressure‐cloud optical thickness joint histograms from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data set. Applying these metrics to the clusters identifies one cluster in particular as a major outlier. Examining the calculations behind these metrics in more detail provides further information about the internal variability of the clusters. The clusters are also examined over several geographic regions showing mostly consistent behavior. There are, however, some large anomalies such as the behavior of the clear sky cluster or the behavior of several different clusters over the Arctic Ocean. To aide our interpretation of these results, two clusters are chosen for a detailed analysis of their subclusters. The geographic distributions and radiative properties of these subclusters are examined and clearly identify that subclusters have physically distinct behavior. This result illustrates that these metrics are capable of determining when a cluster contains physically distinct subclusters. This demonstrates the potential utility of these metrics if they were applied to other geophysical data sets.           ,              Key Points                                                                Subclusters are created for an existing set of MODIS cloud clusters to explore the variability within the clusters                                                     The Davies‐Bouldin index and subsom entropy were used as metrics to identify the least representative clusters                                                     Particular clusters are then directly analyzed using their subclusters, identifying overlooked behavior within these clusters",2023-01,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 22:36,15/04/2024 5:41,e2022EA002373,,1,10,,Earth and Space Science,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the climate warms, the grounded ice sheet and floating ice shelves surrounding Antarctica are melting and releasing additional freshwater into the Southern Ocean. Nonetheless, almost all existing coupled climate models have fixed ice sheets and lack the physics required to represent the dominant sources of Antarctic melt. These missing ice dynamics represent a key uncertainty that is typically unaccounted for in current global climate change projections. Previous modelling studies that have imposed additional Antarctic meltwater have demonstrated regional impacts on Southern Ocean stratification, circulation, and sea ice, as well as remote changes in atmospheric circulation, tropical precipitation, and global temperature. However, these previous studies have used widely varying rates of freshwater forcing, have been conducted using different climate models and configurations, and have reached differing conclusions on the magnitude of meltwater–climate feedbacks. The Southern Ocean Freshwater Input from Antarctica (SOFIA) initiative brings together a team of scientists to quantify the climate system response to Antarctic meltwater input along with key aspects of the uncertainty. In this paper, we summarize the state of knowledge on meltwater discharge from the Antarctic ice sheet and ice shelves to the Southern Ocean and explain the scientific objectives of our initiative. We propose a series of coupled and ocean–sea ice model experiments, including idealized meltwater experiments, historical experiments with observationally consistent meltwater input, and future scenarios driven by meltwater inputs derived from stand-alone ice sheet models. Through coordinating a multi-model ensemble of simulations using a common experimental design, open data archiving, and facilitating scientific collaboration, SOFIA aims to move the community toward better constraining our understanding of the climate system response to Antarctic melt.",19/12/2023,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 22:35,15/04/2024 5:42,7289-7309,,24,16,,Geosci.

This article further explores these relational dynamics by examining how general practitioners (GPs) in Aotearoa New Zealand frame their working relationships with pharmacists. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 GPs from around the country. Interviews had a mean duration of 46 min, and were thematically analysed. RESULTS: GPs saw and used pharmacists as a key source of information about both medicines and patients; thus it was not only pharmacists' training and expertise, but also their community setting and patient proximity, that made them a useful resource to doctors. Furthermore, GPs framed pharmacists as a critical 'safety net' due to their role in catching errors and checking prescribing details. The pharmacy 'safety net' also came through in participants' comments on discount pharmacies, which have introduced pronounced cost-cutting logics to Aotearoa New Zealand's pharmaceutical landscape; in their reflections on these organisations, prescribers express the importance of robust pharmacy practice to their own work.

Drawing upon interviews with 38 women from diverse socio‐cultural backgrounds living in Aotearoa New Zealand, we describe the pandemic as an “arrhythmia”, a radical rupture to the familiar rhythms of their everyday social and working lives. We describe how the pandemic arrhythmia was felt in and through bodies (i.e., sleep, weight), and how women responded by creating counter rhythms (i.e., hobbies, exercise, food) as strategies to support their own and others wellbeing. Furthermore, radically disrupting linear repetitions of everyday work, social and family life, the pandemic prompted many to reflect differently upon how pre‐pandemic rhythms shaped by the social, economic and gendered structures of neoliberalism were causing various forms of alienation (i.e., from their own health and wellbeing, meaningful social connections, ethical and sustainable working practices, and from pleasure). For some women, the pandemic arrhythmia was a puncturing of their normalized time‐space gendered routines, leading to critique and transformation to their everyday work‐life patterns. Engaging a feminist reading of rhythmanalysis, this paper brings into focus how neoliberal gender regimes are reconstituted and disrupted in the rhythms and routines of women's everyday lives. In so doing, we highlight the potential in feminist engagement with arrhythmia to extend understandings of the gendered politics of everyday life during and beyond pandemic times, and the value in such approaches for organizational scholars interested in understanding the gendered rhythms of daily life and their effects on relationships with work.",2023-09,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 22:34,15/04/2024 5:42,1552-1570,,5,30,,Gender Work & Organization,The pandemic as gender arrhythmia,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Historical and ecological factors influence the success of colonization and subsequent diversification, leaving a signal in the genetic constitution of the diverged, range‐restricted taxa. Here, we examined the historical biogeography of endemic marine fishes to quantify the role of geographical proximity and climate differences in determining colonization, and the underlying mechanisms of speciation.

Taxa               Thirty endemic marine ray‐finned fishes from 17 genera.                                         Methods               Using parametric biogeographical history models, we estimated the ancestral geographical ranges for 144 species based on time‐calibrated phylogenies that included endemic species and their closest sister taxa, linking terminal nodes with geographical distribution classified into 14 biogeographical areas.                                         Results               Ancestral range estimations revealed most species originated in Australia (66%), while only 10% and 7% originated in northern tropical Pacific locations and the East Pacific respectively, with 17% of species‐range estimations being inconclusive. Vicariant events alone were identified as the most likely process shaping range evolution in 57% of the 14 best‐fitting models, dispersal alone was favoured for 14% of species and both processes had a role for the remaining 29% of species. Across all phylogenies, likelihood‐ratio tests confirmed that geographical distance and climatic differences constrained dispersal in 73% and 33% of species, respectively.                                         Main Conclusions               Marine fishes endemic to subtropical islands of the Southwest Pacific originated by vicariant and jump‐dispersal events mainly from ancestral populations in mainland Australia.

But they are increasingly threatened with some areas reporting over 90% declines in kelp forest cover in living memory. Despite their importance and the threats they face, kelp forests are entirely absent from the international conservation dialogue. No international laws, policies, or targets focus on kelp forests and very few countries consider them in their national policy. The Kelp Forest Challenge addresses that gap. Together with 252 kelp experts, professionals, and citizens from 25 countries, the Kelp Forest Challenge was developed as a grassroots vision of what the world can achieve for kelp forest conservation. It is a global call to restore 1 million and protect 3 million hectares of kelp forests by 2040. This is a monumental challenge, that will require coordination across multiple levels of society and the mobilization of immense resources. Pledges may therefore include area for protection or restoration, enabling pledges which assist in conservation (funding, equipment, professional expertise, capacity building), or awareness-based pledges which increase awareness or education about kelp forests. Correspondingly, participants may be from government, scientific institutions, private sector, NGOs, community groups, or individuals.

Driven by interest in diseases like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we examine the global biogeography of bat-origin betacoronaviruses, and find that coevolutionary principles suggest geographies of risk that are distinct from the hotspots and coldspots of host richness. Further, our framework helps explain patterns like a unique pool of merbecoviruses in the Neotropics, a recently discovered lineage of divergent nobecoviruses in Madagascar, and—most importantly—hotspots of diversification in southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East that correspond to the site of previous zoonotic emergence events.

Pinatubo volcanic eruption is analyzed using large ensembles of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) historical simulations. In contrast to previous work, we find that standard measures of the global temperature response to volcanic forcing are not significantly correlated with climate sensitivity across models. Isolating the shortwave response due to non‐cloud effects does not improve the correlation with climate sensitivity. Earlier constraints on climate sensitivity based on the response to Mt. Pinatubo are consistent with having arisen by chance because of the small size of the ensembles used. Our results suggest that the response to Mt. Pinatubo cannot be used to constrain the climate sensitivity to increased greenhouse gas concentrations, as has been proposed, because the radiative feedbacks in response to volcanic eruptions are not well correlated with the feedbacks governing the long‐term response to greenhouse gas forcing.           ,              Plain Language Summary             Large volcanic eruptions influence climate by injecting sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere. It has been proposed that the response of the climate system to recent large eruptions can inform estimates of current and anticipated climate change driven by increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by comparing the simulated temperature responses driven by the two types of forcing across a variety of climate models. Here we show that numerous simulations are necessary to quantify the variability of the climate response to recent volcanic eruptions, and taken together the simulations show that the proposed relationship does not exist. Thus volcanic eruptions do not constrain 21st century climate change, and the results of earlier studies are consistent with having arisen by chance owing to the reduced number of simulations that were available. We propose that the lack of relationship is because climate feedbacks differ when driven by volcanic eruptions versus increased carbon dioxide.           ,              Key Points                                                                Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) large ensembles allow the relationship between climate sensitivity and response to volcanic eruptions to be investigated                                                     The climate response to the eruption of Mt.

Synthesis was carried out using heptaldehyde as the starting material, and (13)C atoms and (2)H atoms were introduced via Wittig olefination and deuterogenation steps, respectively. The suitability of this compound as an internal standard was demonstrated by spiking model wine at normal and elevated conditions during sample preparation, with subsequent analysis via mass spectrometry showing stability of (2)H(2)(13)C(2)-γ-nonalactone. A model wine calibration, with concentrations of γ-nonalactone from 0 to 100 µg L(-1), was shown to have excellent linearity (R(2) > 0.99), reproducibility (0.72%), and repeatability (0.38%).

We investigate how the structures of CAP implementation and supporting regional policies might enhance adaptive capacity and resilience building. Methods include a review of the policy, qualitative analysis of policy structures as well as linguistic analysis of policy documents. The case study is an exercise of looking back to look forward—an approach to understand the preconditions for today’s decision-making structures, which have changed tremendously due to Brexit as well as new climate agreements and policies. It provides insights into the starting point of climate adaptation structures for agricultural adaptation decisions that are relevant in the gradual layering of climate change concerns into agricultural reforms after the 2007–2013 reforms of CAP. The article provides insight into (a) what kind of regulatory aspects promote adaptation the agricultural sector (b) if the implementation of the agricultural policy is characterized by adaptive governance as defined in the social-ecological systems and resilience literature.

We considered three groups of macroalgal taxa (class Phaeophyceae and, phyla Chlorophyta and Rhodophyta) for which we developed a “synthetic envelope” of spectrally resolved action spectra using 1 million radiative simulations. We found that brown algae were more efficient at harvesting light across the whole spectrum at low attenuation (< 0.2 m               −1               ) when depths were greater than 10 m, whereas green algae dominated shallower depths than 10 m for low to high attenuation values.

We also demonstrated that the brown and green algal taxa showed higher photosynthetic efficiencies when attenuation was dominated by particulate matter rather than by phytoplankton or detrital matter. Our results shed new light on the “Complementary Chromatic Adaptation” hypothesis by confirming that algal pigmentation matters under a subset of scenarios, particularly at the limits of light availability in coastal waters.

To resolve this gap, we propose a unification of models of biotic interactions and measurements of diversity. We show that analyses of biodiversity obscure details about biotic interactions.

Reverse transcription PCR sensitivity varies over the course of an individual's infection, related to changes in viral load.

METHODS: Using data from New Zealand, we estimate the time-varying sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR under varying temporal, biological, and demographic factors. RESULTS: Sensitivity peaks 4-5 days postinfection at 92.7% (91.4%-94.0%) and remains over 88% between 5 and 14 days postinfection. After the peak, sensitivity declined more rapidly in vaccinated cases compared with unvaccinated, females compared with males, those aged under 40 compared with over 40s, and Pacific peoples compared with other ethnicities.

Reputational scoring can provide the necessary motivation via ""indirect reciprocity,"" but maintaining reliable scores requires close oversight to prevent cheating. We show that in the absence of such supervision, it is possible that scores might be managed by mutual consent between the agents themselves instead of by third parties. The space of possible strategies for such ""consented"" score changes is very large but, using a simple cooperation game, we search it, asking what kinds of agreement can i) invade a population from rare and ii) resist invasion once common. We prove mathematically and demonstrate computationally that score mediation by mutual consent does enable cooperation without oversight. Moreover, the most invasive and stable strategies belong to one family and ground the concept of value by incrementing one score at the cost of the other, thus closely resembling the token exchange that underlies money in everyday human transactions. The most successful strategy has the flavor of money except that agents without money can generate new score if they meet. This strategy is evolutionarily stable, and has higher fitness, but is not physically realizable in a decentralized way; when conservation of score is enforced more money-like strategies dominate. The equilibrium distribution of scores under any of this family of strategies is geometric, meaning that agents with score 0 are inherent to money-like strategies.",6/06/2023,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 22:29,,e2302107120-e2302107120,,23,120,,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,,,,,,,eng,,,PubMed,37253000,,,Number: 23 Edition: 2023/05/30 Place: United States,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\7ZEBJ2ZR\Frean and Marsland - 2023 - Score-mediated mutual consent and indirect recipro.pdf; ; ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10266034/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10266034/,"Biological Evolution; Selection, Genetic; Humans; cooperation; *Cooperative Behavior; *Lymphatic System; evolutionary game theory; Game Theory; indirect reciprocity; Informed Consent; Motivation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The changes in topography resulting from WAIS collapse would be accompanied by significant changes in Antarctic surface climate, atmospheric circulation, and ocean conditions. Evidence of these changes may be recorded in water-isotope ratios in precipitation archived in the ice. We conduct high-resolution simulations with an isotope-enabled version of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model over Antarctica, with boundary conditions provided by climate model simulations with both present-day and lowered WAIS topography. The results show that while there is significant spatial variability, WAIS collapse would cause detectable isotopic changes at several locations where ice-core records have been obtained or could be obtained in the future.

Nonetheless, previous reports on impacts of NT on nitrate () leaching are inconsistent. A global meta‐analysis was conducted to test the hypothesis that the response of  leaching under NT, relative to tillage, is associated with tillage type (inversion vs non‐inversion tillage), soil properties (e.g., soil organic carbon [SOC]), climate factors (i.e., water input), and management practices (e.g., NT duration and nitrogen fertilizer inputs). Overall, compared with all forms of tillage combined, NT had 4% and 14% greater area‐scaled and yield‐scaled  leaching losses, respectively. The  leaching under NT tended to be 7% greater than that of inversion tillage but comparable to non‐inversion tillage. Greater  leaching under NT, compared with inversion tillage, was most evident under short‐duration NT (<5 years), where water inputs were low (<2 mm day               −1               ), in medium texture and low SOC (<1%) soils, and at both higher (>200 kg ha               −1               ) and lower (0–100 kg ha               −1               ) rates of nitrogen addition.

Globally, on average, the greater amount of NO               3               −               leached under NT, compared with inversion tillage, was mainly attributed to corresponding increases in drainage.

However, the major processes driving melt are not adequately represented in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) models. Here, we analyze a novel multi‐model ensemble of CMIP6 models with consistent meltwater addition to examine the robustness of the modeled response to meltwater, which has not been possible in previous single‐model studies. Antarctic meltwater addition induces a substantial weakening of open‐ocean deep convection. Additionally, Antarctic Bottom Water warms, its volume contracts, and the sea surface cools. However, the magnitude of the reduction varies greatly across models, with differing anomalies correlated with their respective mean‐state climatology, indicating the state‐dependency of the climate response to meltwater. A better representation of the Southern Ocean mean state is necessary for narrowing the inter‐model spread of response to Antarctic meltwater.           ,              Plain Language Summary             The melting of the Antarctic ice sheet and ice shelves can have significant impacts on ocean circulation and thermal structure, but current climate models do not fully capture these effects. In this study, we analyze seven climate models to understand how they respond to the addition of meltwater from Antarctica. We find that the presence of Antarctic meltwater leads to a significant weakening of deep convection in the open ocean.

However, the magnitude of the response to meltwater varies across models, suggesting that the mean‐state conditions of the Southern Ocean play a role.

This article aspires to rise to this challenge by conceptualising Pūtaiao as a form of Indigenous research sovereignty. Grounded in Kaupapa Māori Theory, Pūtaiao is envisioned as a Kaupapa Māori way of doing science in which Indigenous leadership is imperative. It incorporates Māori ways of knowing, being, and doing when undertaking scientific research. An essential element of Pūtaiao is setting a decolonising agenda, drawing from both Kaupapa Māori Theory and Indigenous methodologies. Accordingly, this centres the epistemology, ontology, axiology and positionality of researchers in all research, which informs their research standpoint. This approach speaks back to ontological framings of Western scientific research that restrict Indigenous ways of researching in the scientific academy. Furthermore, Pūtaiao offers tools and language to critique the academic disciplines of Western science which are a colonial construct within the global colonising agenda. As such, the theoretical search for Indigenous science(s) and Indigenising agendas explore the dialogical relationship between both knowledge systems – Kaupapa Māori science and Western science. This relationship necessitates setting a decolonising agenda before an Indigenising agenda can be realised, whereby they are mutually beneficial rather than mutually exclusive. This article is an affirmation of the work and discourse of Indigenous scientists. In this way, Pūtaiao becomes a pathway for asserting Indigenous sovereignty over and redefining scientific research for future generations of Māori and Indigenous researchers.",2023-03,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 22:28,15/04/2024 5:38,Nov-37,,1-Feb,2,,Environment and Planning F,(Re)emergence of Pūtaiao,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is expected that anthropogenic disturbances such as climate change and human activities will tend to create less energetically-efficient ecosystems that support less biomass per unit energy flow. It is debated, however, whether this expected development should translate into bottom-heavy (with small basal species being the most abundant) or top-heavy communities (where more biomass is supported at higher trophic levels with species having larger body sizes). Here, we combine ecological theory and empirical data to demonstrate that full marine protection promotes shifts towards top-heavy energetically-efficient structures in marine communities. First, we use metabolic scaling theory to show that protected communities are expected to display stronger top-heavy structures than disturbed communities. Similarly, we show theoretically that communities with high energy transfer efficiency display stronger top-heavy structures than communities with low transfer efficiency. Next, we use empirical structures observed within fully protected marine areas compared to disturbed areas that vary in stress from thermal events and adjacent human activity. Using a nonparametric causal-inference analysis, we find a strong, positive, causal effect between full marine protection and stronger top-heavy structures. Our work corroborates ecological theory on community development and provides a quantitative framework to study the potential restorative effects of different candidate strategies on protected areas.",21/12/2023,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 22:28,,e1011742-e1011742,,12,19,,PLoS Comput Biol,,,,,,,,eng,,,PubMed,38127830,,,Number: 12 Place: United States,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\F84D3Q4D\Tabi et al. - 2023 - Protection promotes energetically efficient struct.pdf; ; ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10769090/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10769090/,Humans; *Ecosystem; *Climate Change; Biomass; Body Size,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior research has primarily focused on examining antecedents that affect professional skepticism. Yet, little is known about auditors’ perceptions and experiences of exercising professional skepticism in everyday audit practice. Through analyzing 78 stories collected from interviewing 35 auditors, our research finds that exercising professional skepticism constitutes a sensemaking process that involves noticing discrepant cues, creating interpretations, and arguing with clients to give sense. Within this process, professional skepticism is constructed by auditors’ microlevel actions and interactions in their collective efforts to seek and interpret meanings of discrepant cues. Prior studies highlight the cognitive and psychological nature of professional skepticism at an individual level. Our study provides an incremental understanding of how professional skepticism is enacted and collectively constructed by auditors in practice and shows that the meanings and practices of professional skepticism are fluid and emergent.",1/11/2023,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 22:28,15/04/2024 5:47,157-178,,4,42,,,Professional Skepticism in Practice,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initially, the focus was on identifying and characterizing the extent of the problem, but more recently efforts have shifted to evidence‐based research designed to identify best solutions and to improve conservation outcomes. Despite extensive accumulation of knowledge on amphibian declines, there remain knowledge gaps and disconnects between science and action that hamper our ability to advance conservation efforts. Using input from participants at the ninth World Congress of Herpetology, a U.S. Geological Survey Powell Center symposium, amphibian on‐line forums for discussion, the International Union for Conservation of Nature Assisted Reproductive Technologies and Gamete Biobanking group, and respondents to a survey, we developed a list of 25 priority research questions for amphibian conservation at this stage of the Anthropocene. We identified amphibian conservation research priorities while accounting for expected tradeoffs in geographic scope, costs, and the taxonomic breadth of research needs. We aimed to solicit views from individuals rather than organizations while acknowledging inequities in participation. Emerging research priorities (i.e., those under‐represented in recently published amphibian conservation literature) were identified, and included the effects of climate change, community‐level (rather than single species‐level) drivers of declines, methodological improvements for research and monitoring, genomics, and effects of land‐use change. Improved inclusion of under‐represented members of the amphibian conservation community was also identified as a priority.

The simulated annealing algorithm is tested on two synthetic datasets of Southern Ocean phytoplankton communities.

These powerful morphodynamic systems are prone to recurrent bar reworking and channel shift. When parts of the riverbed are temporarily abandoned by active channels, they are vulnerable to land use intensification. Associated flood protection measures that often follow intensification constrict the rivers' capacity to adjust to ever‐changing flows of water and sediment. Despite the rivers' vulnerability and constriction, New Zealand law defines braided rivers in a way that limits local councils' authority to manage land use within the braidplain. This paper explores the relationship between the law and science of braided rivers, demonstrating how legislative reforms underway in 2023 express the ways in which particular social processes play out in the landscape.",2024-01,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 22:27,15/04/2024 5:27,Oct-14,,1,49,,Earth Surf Processes Landf,New Zealand's braided rivers,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cloud is a flexible, low cost and highly available technology, but it comes with increased complexity in maintaining the cloud consumer’s security. In this research, a model was built to assist strategic decision-makers in choosing from a diverse range of actions that can be taken to manage cloud security.                                         Design/methodology/approach               Published research from 2010 to 2022 was reviewed to identify alternatives to management actions pertaining to cloud security. Analytical hierarchical process (AHP) was applied to rate the most important action(s). For this, the alternatives, along with selection criteria, were summarized through thematic analysis. To gauge the relative importance of the alternatives, a questionnaire was distributed among cloud security practitioners to poll their opinion. AHP was then applied to the aggregated survey responses.                                         Findings               It was found that the respondents gave the highest importance to aligning information security with business needs. Building a cloud-specific risk management framework was rated second, while the actions: enforce and monitor contractual obligations, and update organizational structure, were rated third and fourth, respectively.

Until very recently, the imagery available for young women to connect with and aspire to has been highly limited, failing to represent the embodied cultural beliefs that Indigenous and culturally-minoritised young women may have towards the gendered body. In this paper, we draw upon focus groups (wānanga) and digital diaries with young, physically active Māori and Pasifika wāhine (women) in Aotearoa New Zealand, to reveal how they are making meaning out of dominant framings of beauty, and drawing upon cultural knowledge to refuse such portrayals, instead reclaiming power in their own bodies. Working at the intersection of Mana Wahine and Masi methodologies, this article amplifies the voices of young Māori and Pasifika wāhine who actively participate in sport and/or physical activity, embrace and appreciate their strong brown bodies, and are critically reading and rejecting dominant Western framings of beauty and femininity.

New Omicron subvariants have subsequently emerged with a significant growth advantage over the previously dominant BA.2. We investigated a mathematical model that included waning of vaccine-derived and infection-derived immunity, as well as the impact of the BA.5 subvariant which began spreading in New Zealand in May 2022. The model was used to provide scenarios to the New Zealand Government with differing levels of BA.5 growth advantage, helping to inform policy response and healthcare system preparedness during the winter period. In all scenarios investigated, the projected peak in new infections during the BA.5 wave was smaller than in the first Omicron wave in March 2022. However, results indicated that the peak hospital occupancy was likely to be higher than in March 2022, primarily due to a shift in the age distribution of infections to older groups.

In late 2021, high vaccine coverage enabled the country to transition away from the elimination strategy to a mitigation strategy. However, given negligible levels of immunity from prior infection, this required careful planning and an effective public health response to avoid uncontrolled outbreaks and unmanageable health impacts. Here, we develop an age-structured model for the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 including the effects of vaccination, case isolation, contact tracing, border controls and population-wide control measures. We use this model to investigate how epidemic trajectories may respond to different control strategies, and to explore trade-offs between restrictions in the community and restrictions at the border. We find that a low case tolerance strategy, with a quick change to stricter public health measures in response to increasing cases, reduced the health burden by a factor of three relative to a high tolerance strategy, but almost tripled the time spent in national lockdowns. Increasing the number of border arrivals was found to have a negligible effect on health burden once high vaccination rates were achieved and community transmission was widespread.",2023-02,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 4:20,15/04/2024 5:44,220766,,2,10,,R.

Many community models first specify pairwise biotic interactions and then secondarily examine how extrinsic factors such as abiotic conditions affect species abundances. A disadvantage of this approach is that the species interactions themselves are often environment and context specific, making parameterization difficult. We propose an alternative approach, matrix community models (MCMs), which are sets of matrix population models linked by an assumption of aggregate density dependence. MCMs incorporate detailed species autecology but are neutral with respect to pairwise species interactions, instead allowing interactions to be revealed within the model structure. These model-revealed species interactions, including competitive exclusion, facilitation, and interference competition, shape the distribution and abundance of species within communities and generate empirically testable predictions about species interactions. We develop a framework for building MCMs using vital rates in a stochastic, multispecies framework. Single-species matrix population models are connected via an assumption of aggregate density dependence, pairwise species interactions are estimated with sensitivity analysis, and community trajectories are analyzed under different environmental regimes using standard statistical tools and network analysis. MCMs have the advantage that pairwise species interactions need not be specified a priori, and that mechanistic demographic-environment linkages permit forecasting of community dynamics under novel, non-stationary environmental regimes. A challenge is that species’ autecological vital rates, such as fecundity, growth and survivorship, must be measured under a diverse range of environmental conditions to parameterize the models. We illustrate the approach with examples and discuss prospects for future theoretical and empirical developments.",4/12/2023,14/04/2024 23:07,30/05/2024 1:10,15/04/2024 5:37,26,,1,2,,npj biodivers,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\User\Zotero\storage\WS3F3L9B\Lytle and Tonkin - 2023 - Matrix community models for ecology and evolution.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results showed that high amphibian and bird richness and endemism correlated with a reduction in malaria risk. The presence of forest had a risk-increasing effect, but it depended on its juxtaposition with anthropic land uses.
